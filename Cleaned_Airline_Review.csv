,July 2022,Nairobi to New York via London,2,Trip Verified,has taken a nosedive in my opinion,"Customer service is non-existent. For over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. Nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on BA.com I was flying to Nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly, My sister and husband had tickets on the July 18 from Nairobi to JFK. When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. It took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. My niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy?

J Gandre,,Dublin to London City,1,Not Verified,they have no idea where our bags are,"Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag.

The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles.

At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day.

Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines.

After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold.

The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth.

Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in.

We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen.

Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware.

Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs.

David Ellis,,Cape Town to London Heathrow,8,Trip Verified,Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard,"Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule.

On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor.

Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service.

Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food.

We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight.

It was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably.

Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant.

R Bowen,,Las Vegas to Gatwick,3,Trip Verified,very disappointing service,"Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better.

I'm a able bodied, fit BA customer and Silver member and was seated at an Emergency Exit seat. I'd put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions. A cabin crew member, came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and I was listening to him and responding, despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers, which he called earplugs. I explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems when I fly. I told him I could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had!

O Robins,,London to Belfast,1,Trip Verified,don’t trust BA with your loved ones,"London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

I repeated many times the word ale with my Spanish accent, but she still did not catch it. The male attendant said “like an IPA”, I answered “yes”.  I changed to a beer and she offered me Amstel or Heineken, I chose Amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. When the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. For the meal I chose the beef and asked for a beer. The male attendant realized that the empty can was still there, took it.

Rosemary Prescott,,London Heathrow to Austin,10,Not Verified,"staff wonderful. cheerful, efficient","We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars!

J. Knopf,,London to Johannesburg,2,Not Verified,buyer beware,"London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight.

However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro.

I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip.

Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed.

Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace!

The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane.

Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.

You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats.

Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten.

Preslava Eneva,February 2019,Amsterdam to London,2,Trip Verified,overall experience was terrible,"I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam,London,,52.3730796,4.8924534,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Nederland",51.5074456,-0.1277653,"London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom"

We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably.

As an act of desperation I today called a British number. The lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available. Some other numbers I tried were available on weekdays only, good to know if you need help on a Sunday. So I‘ve got the strong feeling, that they do not even care about there customers.

The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15"". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must've been.

Pawornprach Pakdeeteva,,Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow,8,Trip Verified,the cabin was modern and clean,"I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Leeds Bradford,London Heathrow,,53.86665035,-1.656781884498208,"Leeds Bradford Airport, Scotland Lane, Moor Side, Yeadon, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, LS19 7TU, United Kingdom",51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, Northern Perimeter Road, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 2RS, United Kingdom"
Peter Driscoll,,Gatwick to Tenerife,7,Not Verified,most uncomfortable plane,"Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick,Tenerife,,51.1541082,-0.1823116499127204,"London Gatwick Airport, Perimeter Road East, Lowfield Heath, Crawley, West Sussex, England, RH6 0JJ, United Kingdom",28.2935785,-16.621447121144122,

B Stauffer,,Johannesburg to London,1,Trip Verified,a total disappointment,"Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast.

Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. This will be my last time flying with BA unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the A380. I am dreading on my next return flight back to London. Crews were friendly and helpful.

Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin.

Thankfully BA airline staff are always the best.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow,Hong Kong,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",22.350627,114.1849161,"香港 Hong Kong, 中国"

S Andrews,,London to Athens,3,Trip Verified,the quality becomes worse,"London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays). What is that makes BA in European flights distinct?

K Lorney,April 2018,Amman to London,1,Trip Verified,pathetic compensation,"Amman to London. Appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. We are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said 'We don't provide that sort of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amman,London,,31.9515694,35.9239625,"عمان, ناحية عمان, لواء قصبة عمان, عمان, 11110, الأردن",51.5074456,-0.1277653,"London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom"

It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it.

The plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded 35 minutes late. When we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around. The service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated. The return flight was a disaster. The seats were dirty, food was like rubber, plane was dated, seats smelt, Lauren Perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason, some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great. When I complained I was offered 8,000 Avios, are you serious BA? I think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that I experienced on British Airways. Unless a first class ticket on British Airways is on sale, I would suggest you fly with another airline.

I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely.

I wouldn't book business class again, felt like bad value for money. I've flown economy and premium economy before, found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space. I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. I had one person ask if I needed anything who then brought me the tea I requested. The staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of money.

It's worlds away from what it used to be, both crews were attentive, friendly and cheerful. Really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to. You now get a light day blanket, a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat, much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get.

Marsha Sheldon,May 2018,Los Angeles to London,1,Not Verified,no one to solve problems,"Los Angeles to London. I booked with AA, LAX to LHR round trip very far in advance. BA is AA partner. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. BA canceled the flights (coming and going), BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceled. All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we can't help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. After returning, I made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Don't ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle.

We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again.

S Weare,,Washington to London,2,Trip Verified,this experience was a disgrace,"Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade.

Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey.

C Norton,,São Paulo to London Heathrow,5,Trip Verified,Not value for money,"I have been flying with BA for the last 32 years between Sao Paulo and London on and off but mostly BA. I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg!

My partner and I had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. As more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. The flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to us and says ""I'm sorry but the space is needed for large bags"", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. Reducing our leg room to zero. How is this at all fair? I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that I would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. I have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean ""thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we'll take away your leg room"". The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. Young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant service. What a sad state of affairs. I will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. I would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with Lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest,London Heathrow,,47.4978918,19.0401609,"Budapest, Közép-Magyarország, Magyarország",51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, Northern Perimeter Road, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 2RS, United Kingdom"

Charles Gwillim,,St Lucia to Gatwick,2,Trip Verified,complete waste of money,"St Lucia to Gatwick. As this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and I now wish we'd saved the extra that it cost, a complete waste of money. The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. On top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier.

Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were eaten. I commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising.

Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. After a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the Hilton hotel next door. So we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to collect our vouchers. We duly went along to the Hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. So at this stage my husband and I decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to London safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Oh dear BA, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just too efficient for you I guess. So we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem BA we didn't mind forking out another £5 to cover it.

L Vanton,,London to Houston,1,Trip Verified,currently looking for the luggage,"London to Houston. Executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at 6 possible flights per day. The staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 USD to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes, furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end. Needless to say that because we are away for Christmas & New Year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team. I repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that BA and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority. Because we have been given 801 USD No phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today's flight. Furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested BA return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves.

H Kawaldha,,London to Toulouse,1,Trip Verified,no longer a full service airline,London to Toulouse. British Airways is no longer a full service airline. To compete with EasyJet and Ryan Air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with M&S food. This is over-priced and not that great. Secondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket price. This was the case in this flight to Toulouse. Next time go to Pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. I asked for a glass of water. This came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. At least offer people water - it is a human right. The seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. In this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  I was told by the cabin crew when I asked about the new service level that more may be in store for BA's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. I hope that this is not true. The only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. Customer care and service has gone. Avoid BA if you can. Consume your BA miles and shift to other full service carriers.

The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat, if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end.

Saunders Mark,,Cape Town to London,2,Not Verified,It was the most uncomfortable flight,"Verified Review   Flew Cape Town to London with British Airways. It’s hard to think of a good thing about this flight. On the outward journey I was in an aisle seat. Next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat. The crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt. So three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours. The food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heated. It was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken.

Edward Warren,,London to Philadelphia,8,Not Verified,crew amazingly helpful,"Verified Review   London to Philadelphia. Ticket booked was an AMEX companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for £2.5k in business class return so very good value. Positives - B747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great IFE. Cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful. T5 Lounge fine, flight on time. Bags off very quickly. Negatives - food on on both legs wasn't great. Salad poor and main beef meal very average. Pudding which is normally the show stopper - not great. In previous years food been excellent. Return journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to help. The real test of the crew was on landing at LHR, we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me. We were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. They were amazing. They didn't have to as they were done for the day.

Komalpreet Gill,October 2017,Oakland to Gatwick,1,Not Verified,requested Asian vegetarian food,"Verified Review   I requested Asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th November, but I was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled.  I was told that on my connection flight I have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at Phoenix airport for connection flight which I never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight. When I reached Phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then I had to go on the different level to check in, then down to go through security again to board my flight. On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage, so please keep it unlocked.  I requested Asian vegetarian food but when I got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet. When I mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said that’s what you asked for but I said sorry I didn’t as on the food label clearly says 18A and my seat no is 18K so how is this my food. She still didn’t believe me instead of apology she said I have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you.

After reading very mixed reviews here, I also saw that BA were upgrading standards on flights to NYC in particular and was looking forward to my flight.

Aircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word go. Staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown when I have to pay for the ticket.

Cabin was dirty - carpets, table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. Everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink, choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful.

Not really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young baby.

The facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits, it's a mess. Why? Because you get other people stumbling on your feet during mid-flight. Or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid-sleep every time they need to use the restroom? The TV monitors colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. Getting the brightness right to make the colors work. Because if you don't want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze time, good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. The worst thing was the food - salad was frozen. The beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. My partner's chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise, it was hitting all the wrong spots. They believe in Umami and dump a ton of MSGs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong. I ended up eating bread and butter only. Same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. Bacon was extra salty.  And the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad.

Our outward flight to Vancouver was delayed by approx an hour. We were seated on the top deck and I was impressed by the room we had (window/Aisle and 3 middle seats). The crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etc. Food was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way. On our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind. Again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely. Food was again just ok. We had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of Fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep. He was drenched and I had no spare clothes for him. I spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn't be more helpful. She found some first class PJs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight.

Club Europe cabin was not really a business class cabin, but economy with the centre seat converted into a table. Other than a lack of leg room and reduced seat recline the cabin was fine. The meals served was very good with a simple starter, decent hot main course and tasty dessert. There was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flight. The senior cabin crew looking after the cabin were very good and could not do enough for you. The cabin was clean in both directions.

Doris Ward,August 2017,San Jose to Gatwick,9,Not Verified,staff were friendly and efficient,"Verified Review   San Jose to London Gatwick return. The outward flight was delayed for an hour at San Jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervals. On the flight I was lucky enough to have two empty seats alongside my aisle seat as the man in the seat directly in front of mine reclined his seat fully as soon as we took off, making it impossible to hold a book at reading distance and then jiggled and bounced as he watched the IFE - it would have been a miserable flight without a seat to move along to. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient and did not disappear after the meal service but answered passengers calls and made the rounds with water and fruit juice. The food was of good quality so it was, despite the delay, a good experience. On the return, boarding was swift and efficient, and the cabin staff, once again, friendly and helpful. Food not as interesting as on the outward leg, but perfectly acceptable. I usually try to take a cheaper flight, involving connections, but this direct flight was well worth the extra expense.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose,London Gatwick,,37.3361663,-121.890591,"San Jose, Santa Clara County, California, United States",51.1541082,-0.1823116499127204,"London Gatwick Airport, Perimeter Road East, Lowfield Heath, Crawley, West Sussex, England, RH6 0JJ, United Kingdom"

E Hanner,,Nice to London Heathrow,1,Not Verified,they are now a junk airline,"Verified Review   Nice to London Heathrow. I had to fly to Nice and back for work. Booked through the Company travel Agency. Extra bag added both ways. I wanted to fly back to LHR earlier so my Travel Agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 GBP. When I arrived at NCE the Ground Staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that it was for the earlier flight. I stood my ground, but the Head of Check in told me if I wanted to fly I had to pay 75 EUR which I did under duress. I had prebooked my seat as Silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which I loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic. I asked for my bags to be offloaded and I would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate.  The trend for BA in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance that means I will not be choosing this airline again. I have one more flight with them next week and that's it. I paid almost 1100 pounds to get to Nice and back today, in economy, I was greeted with disdain by Ground Staff, the Crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who, despite the high prices, have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic.

Problems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to Gatwick. From various conversations that took place, it would appear that there were no British Airways staff at Venice Marco Polo airport; everything is handled by the local service agents. Obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents, they need to be made aware and re-trained if necessary as no doubt BA are paying them money to carry out their duties.  Announcements were unclear especially in the lounge, the departure board information did not help. After arriving at 13:00 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away, arriving at 24:00. The following day, on the replacement flight, we were taxiing out and a flight-deck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed.

Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared to get on last, be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it’s a win.

However our seats were changed due to aircraft configuration change which is normal to happen, but no any choice or apology was offered (for Silver member!). No complimentary service onboard provided. Crew even had problem with the payment machine. Luckily I've got some water and treats from the airport shops. Cramped cabins and uncomfortable seats - now BA is just a budget airline charging premium prices and has worse service than other budget airlines!  I've abandoned my Silver status and considering using other airlines.

B Simpson,,New York JFK to London Heathrow,1,Not Verified,other carriers must be laughing,"Verified Review   New York JFK - London Heathrow. The British Airways lounge at JFK is truly terrible. It seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowds. Not enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each other. I wasn’t allowed into the First Class lounge despite being a BA Gold List member. So much for loyalty. Was instructed at check in that this was a “sleeper service” and I should eat in the lounge. Not an advisory but an instruction. The Club World food on offer in the lounge for the “dining experience” was overcooked and of very poor quality. Usual Cub World service on BA which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle, poor food (they did offer food), poor in-flight entertainment, putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up (BA train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again) to serve food and drinks. The crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordingly. The product and offer from BA is so mediocre (I even saw Club Class passengers taking their own food on for example) the other carriers must be laughing as they take over BA in terms of service and quality of aircraft.

I sat on the top floor of the A380 after being upgraded from World Traveller at the gate, and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from Singapore to London Heathrow. There were two dinner options, chicken tikka or beef fillet, but as I dozed off I missed out. So no food until 1 hour before landing (11 hours later) unless I wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card. I kindly asked for some water, got some orange juice too - didn't want to push it even though I saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley - not worth the risk of a bad reaction. I cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge.

H Jackson,June 2017,Singapore to London,2,Not Verified,I am very disappointed,"Verified Review   Singapore to London. I have started to take British Airways as it's a corporate requirement. The Business Class (Club World) is more like Premium Economy. The seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window - you are basically trapped inside and you'd have to disturb the other passenger to get out. Furthermore, the ""bed"" does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift ""fold down stool"" - if you apply too much pressure on that stool, it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch - it's just flimsy! The food is very low quality and tatstes bland - I have already tried the regular meal and special meals - don't bother. The service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers.

,,London Heathrow to Madrid,3,Not Verified,third world experience,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Madrid. An absolute third world experience once I got on the plane. Check-in and lounge experience were great, but once I got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are. There were seats with missing backs and 'Do Not Occupy' covers in front and beside them, random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead, and grimy, yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. You have to worry about what's going on the important bits, like the engines, if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. The crew spent as much time as they could in the galley, and interacted with passengers as little as possible. The breakfast service was a salt-infused hot cooked offering, and just one run of drinks. Anything else you wanted you had to use the call button. The one and only reason I booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing I'd bought.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow,Madrid,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",40.4167047,-3.7035825,"Madrid, Comunidad de Madrid, España"

P Reardon,,London City to Milan,1,Not Verified,a bare-bones airline,Verified Review  London City to Milan. The price of the ticket about £500 for a 2 hour flight - had no relationship to the ultra-economy service on this flight. The aircraft was very dirty - I wonder whether BA pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines don't seem to have filthy aircraft. In Business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for? There is no place to power devices and forget WiFi or overhead screens. In business the food was an awful English breakfast. No better than economy. The embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to take-away to try and make up for the no-frills service. It feels chronic under investment for years has left this a bare-bones airline milking short-term profits and forgetting that their business model should be more than just for 1 year.,Business,Business Class,London City,Milan,,42.9537654,-81.2291529,,45.4641943,9.1896346,"Milano, Lombardia, Italia"

Again as too often with British Airways nowadays, flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problem.

Since our late arrival was known by BA at least 5 hours in advance why didn't they at least pre-book our connecting flight from LHR. Long queues at rebooking desk, very little care of customers. Then again flight from LHR left late! Breakfast on board long haul miserable. Service on board short haul now equals those of charter flights.

The seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class, the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphones.

In fact I have experienced far better service on EasyJet. We waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and I ordered Marks & Spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours. On top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them. Of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took!

You have to be very careful when choosing a flight to New York. Most of the JFK flights are 20+ years old Boeing 747-400s - prone to breaking down on the tarmac. The 747 ""New 1st"" is so cramped and I avoid any 747 flight whenever possible. I deliberately choose Newark as it is served by a new Boeing 787. Coming back we were on one - with just 8 seats in 1st Class. Its not bad, a bit better than the Boeing 777 - but nowhere close to Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. The lounge is a shared one with Cathay Pacific. Its ok, but apart from a ""1st"" dining area, 1st class passengers are bundled in with Club passengers. It is a nice set up though. Boarded on time and had dinner. Tasteless starter of prawns and fennel. Horrible soup. Chicken mains was ok. Wines ok. The bed was made up and I slept for a few hours. We were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedule.

Julie Torcasio,April 2017,London Heathrow to Bangkok,7,Not Verified,pay extra to reserve the seats,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Bangkok. We had already flown BA10 from Bangkok to London a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route. Of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked J and K seats. Check in at LHR was good, lounge at T5 was packed (Friday afternoon), and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight. No priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn't even get to our seats! On boarding, toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door (why wasn't it fixed prior to the flight?). For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them. Constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet! Not good enough. Food and wine were OK and crew were good. Flat bed was good.

I am sad to say British Airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one.

R Moody,,LHR to IST,1,Not Verified,I am ever increasingly disappointed,"Verified Review   London to Istanbul. I am ever increasingly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited. The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class.",Business,Business Class,London Heathrow,Istanbul - Istanbul Atatürk Airport,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",40.9782416,28.826317699492456,"İstanbul Atatürk Havalimanı, Eski Havaalanı Caddesi, Yeşilköy Mahallesi, Bakırköy, İstanbul, Marmara Bölgesi, 34149, Türkiye"

The flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embarrassed and have nothing to offer. All this would be fine but British Airways still charges premium prices and for what?

I called BA and they said the flight is under airport control and I have to check in at the airport. Fair enough but I should have known something was wrong. When I get to the airport 3 hours ahead (I wanted to get a good seat) I was told that Premium Economy was overbooked, and that I was involuntarily being bumped to economy. Never mind that I bought and paid for the ticket 4 months ago. The staff were not even nice about it. Quite beligerent. They offered me a Compensation card for $94. Where they got this amount, I don't know. I would have preferred the seat. Then they tell me I need to contact BA for a refund of the difference in price. Why should I need to contact them? They moved me, they know they moved me, shouldn't it be automatic? So I am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake. I did send an e-mail on their refund form and have yet to hear from them. It has been a week. I had a horrible flight. I have severe back pain (one reason I booked premium, for the extra room) which was made worse by my economy seat. My screen did not work for movies, although the flight attendants did try. It is as though they wanted to make me have a bad trip. Fast forward, while in France, I tried to use the Compensation Card, declined.  So I tried to use it on Amazon and Nespresso online. Also declined. Really BA? I sent another e-mail telling them the card is not working. Nothing. I have flown BA in the past and have been happy with the. Not anymore.  I have had it with BA.

G Graham,,London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica,1,Not Verified,BA have totally lost the plot,"Verified Review   Flew London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks, towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had to request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. Collection of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. Hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Co. need to take a flight on Emirates, Qatar etc. to realise their failings. Business seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs aren't. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. I don't think they have a clue what they are doing.

We were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour. The lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert. What we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse than usual. The only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle, which, if you are a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvre. This all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers, and we, like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that BA is being turned into Vueling.

C Haines,,Miami to London,3,Not Verified,feel disrespected and undervalued,"Verified Review   The cabin crew, bar one lazy individual, were excellent. T5 feels like a monopoly - Galleries Lounge food is simply appalling. Between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food. Unused hot food is removed at 9.30am sharp. Why not leave it ??? So all you have is bread and stodgy croissants. The upstairs of the A380 was in need of a serious clean. Cabin crew friendly, although you can sense lower morale. BA flights are often late now in my experience. The Club World A380 seats aren't comfortable. Despite everyone knowing, crossing over someone's legs too get out is still a nuisance. There is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing - I had one bloke shout at me when I'd been waiting long before him and he'd just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in.  Many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued, let down after years of loyalty and serious spending. We're not getting what we're paying for, although charged.

J Egleton,,London Heathrow to Munich,5,Not Verified,BA is now a no-frills carrier,"❎ Unverified   London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier. Lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow,Munich,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",48.1371079,11.5753822,"München, Bayern, Deutschland"

H Rainer,February 2017,London Heathrow to Bangkok,1,Not Verified,this is by far the worst,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Bangkok. As you walk into Heathrow T5 you have the feeling of a world class airline - and that's where it stopped! 20 minutes late for boarding then only after they had got everyone on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up - it took them 1 hour to fix the plane didn't tell us what the problem was and remove the passengers bags! I gave up my seat 38D for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so I got 40D - big mistake! Seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down. Upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above - when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and I heard her say to a co-worker that's the last of her problems. It was the coldest plane I have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets I was that cold I took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet. Toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight. They had to manually reset everyone's screens, they were very old, the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired. Not to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lag. The interior on the seating was old and lumpy I'm sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw! They don't even have USB's to charge your phone!  So they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any USB charge points around the plane. Going to email BA and ask for a refund on my return ticket as I can honestly say out of the 20 or so airlines I have flown on over the years this is by far the worst!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow,Bangkok,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",13.8245796,100.6224463,"กรุงเทพมหานคร, ประเทศไทย"

This was an older 777 with a 3-3-3 configuration (31"" seat pitch) in economy and comfortable seats. I flew to South Africa this time last year with Virgin on their new B787 and it was a nightmare.

Peter Hill,,London Heathrow to Stuttgart,1,Not Verified,no better than no frills competitors,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Fly in comfort and style is the slogan of British Airways, but there is not much of either around these days. Not willing to pay an extra £8, I was allocated a middle seat right at the rear. At the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their hand-luggage ""at no extra cost"". Within a minute a burly employee told me I had to check in my cabin bag, saying ""you should not believe what is said on the company's website"". How very true! Some ten other passengers, equally perplexed suffered the same fate. I know there were ten, because another employee kept counting us and saying ""we need ten"". The burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bags. All in all a demeaning experience. The seat rows are now more tightly packed than before. Although of average slim build, I found the seat a tight fit. Only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink (the deceptive ""upgrade"" we were sold at the beginning of the year). But still, did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing. Not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared, but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers. On the return journey I noticed part of the reason for this new policy: the Stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff. BA is now no better than the no frills competitors, but keeps the facade of a full service airline with full service prices. A loyal customer of many, many years, I will choose their competitors in future.",Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow,Stuttgart,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",48.7784485,9.1800132,"Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Deutschland"

Michael Davies,,London Heathrow to Rome,5,Not Verified,on a race to the bottom,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. There was a 20-25 minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points. The payment added significant times to process. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. There was only the one trolley, and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. CEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy, 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though I'm a Silver Exec club member I am now considering my future travel options.

Made lengthy phone calls and same response was given that nothing could be done about it until the airport. Arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and I didn't get our seats together - ground staff could do nothing about it.

N Smee,,Doha to London Heathrow,3,Not Verified,British Airways was a shock,"Verified Review   Doha to London Heathrow. Having flown into Doha with Qatar Airways, the flight with British Airways was a shock. For a start the Club world seats are not comfortable. There is hardly anywhere to stow bits and pieces. The cabin crew were indifferent. We departed at approximately 9am. Immediately on reaching cruising altitude, we were informed that they were now serving ""lunch"". At 10am. We were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent, this on a 7 hour flight. A cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early. I don't know what timezone ""lunch"" was in, possibly Bangkok, but certainly not Doha or London time. After 5 hours I rang the bell. The female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously, ""did you ring the bell""? Yes, once, the entire flight. I asked for the sandwich and she told me that I would have to wait. No, I want it now. Not a five course meal, a sandwich. Having just flown on Qatar Airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time, apparently a pre-prepared sandwich was a big ask. In business class. I was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flight. I did complain immediately to BA and to their credit, I received a response - basically they were sorry I felt this way. Never again.

The brand is now cheapened, the offering before wasn't gourmet, but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit, now you can't even get hot water for free. Even SAS offer a complimentary coffee. What ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by British Airways in every single class you travel, yet you don't see a decrease in ticket prices.

The food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up. After dinner, the crew member assigned to me, a mirthful Frenchman, made my bed and I had six hours sleep to wake up to breakfast consisting of fruit followed by a full English.

C Drake,,MRU to LGW,2,Not Verified,Goodbye British Airways,"Verified Review   London Gatwick to Mauritius return. Our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to British Airways we were prepared to wait and see. The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it was awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. Is nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?  On arrival in UK we read that BA is to put even more seats in Economy class on this type of aircraft.

Martin Roper,,LGW to MCO,2,Not Verified,nothing short of a joke,"Verified Review   First time using British Airways as always flown Virgin but routes from Orlando to Gatwick were full with Virgin. The flight was cancelled with no reason for 24 hours. No apologies, a text message sent to my phone 4 hours before departure with no telephone or contact number. After an hour of ringing everybody I could at BA I ended up being passed to an offshore call centre. If you deal with BA this will be where you call for everything - cut off three times and completely incoherent. I was traveling with my wife and 9 year old daughter in ""Club World"" seating. The plane was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable, it was in a dire state. My daughter commented ""this is like a dustbin with wings daddy"" when we got into the cabin. On arrival to my ""Club World"" bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere. I handed it to a stewardess who said ""that bit isn't important"" whilst looking down at me and taking it away. The inflight system was a joke, the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anything. All the pixels were broken. The charging for laptops etc was US only and the remote for the entertainment system didn't work. An announcement came on before we left ""we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergy. Please do not eat any nuts at anytime"". Once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut! I am proud to be British, but I am incredibly embarrassed for British Airways to represent my country in such a poor way.

S Hunt,October 2016,LHR to BOS,2,Not Verified,Will not use BA again,Our flight from London to Boston was okay. Disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of 10. Annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. Also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. The return flight was different. Staff not particularly helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency. We had one drinks trolley followed by a meal around an hour later. Staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight. Will not use BA again.

Chris Malone,,LHR to JFK,3,Not Verified,leg room was poor,"British Airways state that you can check in for free. When I checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight, there were only three seats available for the three of us. I also like to have a window seat however only available seats were aisle seats in C or J. Due to online check in, I had only the option to select an aisle seat. At T5 at LHR I spoke to BA customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat, only certain seats will appear available - in short, the less you pay, you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft was a 747-400 reg G-CIVV built in 1998. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. However the aircraft tables were not clean, leg room was poor and the 747 is ""an embarrassment"". These are the words of a cabin crew member, not me. True - the 747 is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliners. Cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen, only towards the start of the flight. Food was ok - veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse. However only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee.

It is reliable and safe but the attitude of the cabin staff put me off. It therefore came as a pleasant surprise that this seems to have changed. The stewardesses were very friendly and attentive. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 with a seat configuration of 3+3+3 which was good. In-flight entertainment was very good and it worked. Boarding at Seoul Incheon airport was surprisingly quick. We departed more or less on time and got to London on time but had to do one circuit because of traffic.

Silver card holder, so made my way to Terraces North. Plenty of seating available although sadly I was too early for the dinner service so ploughed my way through the rather poor ""afternoon tea"" sandwiches. Wine selections however were tip top. Boarding at remote C65 quickly turned into a scrum, with passengers crowding around the entry gates preventing passengers invited to board from doing so. BA part to blame for boarding the A380 so late before the scheduled departure time. On board flight down to JNB was up to scratch with a bright young mixed-feet crew and good service levels. The IFE on the A380 puts that on its sister BA fleet wide body aircraft to shame. On time arrival in JNB and then onto the morning BA (Comair) connection to CPT.

Michael Laing,,HKG to LHR,4,Not Verified,no longer my airline of choice,"I was very disappointed to find that British Airways are now a very 'middle of the road' airline compared to a decade ago. Why? Firstly, compared to my only other flight in an A380 (Qatar Airways) there are more seats crammed into the BA business. On the outbound flight, only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and on the return flight my in-flight entertainment screen was broken which meant that it was not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position. The only possible solution the steward could find (as there was a critical bolt missing) was to wedge it with a cork which sounds very 'Flintstones' for a 21st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view (very annoying when you are half way through a film). The flat bed and window cabin storage was good but the beef that was my chosen main course was tough, tasteless and quite inedible. I gave up after 10 minutes of trying to cut it and chew it. They did at least have a nice bordeaux red wine. The staff did well enough.

The flight was quiet and smooth, on time and made up time on the flight.

We did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about 15 people into business, the rest of us went without for 8 hours.

Clearly BA's cost-cutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine 'cattle-class' experience. They really need to up their game to compete with Singapore Airlines and Emirates - who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level. BA - where do I start? Cramped seats - even felt extremely small to the children (6 and 8) and little leg room. That feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. The food was laughable - yes, it says on the marketing blurb there are 12+ menus to choose from, but it fails to mention that they are inedible. I thought the children's meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet - the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush. The entertainment system just about kept the children entertained - but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack, quality 'kids' treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.If you have a choice go with another airline.

The booking process is dreadful - they charge if you want to change seat in economy, I have been told they will be charging for food and drink from January, and the website very difficult to use. Their customer ""service"" via phone or email is abysmal (they are extremely rude, give completely wrong information, and I have been cut off, given wrong numbers and put through to loop messages). Whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely, many are extremely unhelpful. This week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker (the bag was not oversized, but I have a bad back at present, and I asked him very politely) - yet he outright refused though he helped other people. I flew Club class a month ago and the fold out table was filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee rings and salt scattered everywhere and I had to actively ask him to clean it. Which he did, but with very bad grace. I avoid British Airways if I can, but sometimes the flight routes and times fit best with my needs.

It took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in London.

K Thomsen,,LHR to BKK,5,Not Verified,expectations low and still disappointed,"Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Fast check-in by friendly staff at LHR. The Galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok. Boarding started approx. 50 min before departure with boarding through L2. Unlike most of the Middle Eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point. Based on reviews here I had set my expectations of BA low and I was still disappointed.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow,,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",13.68187665,100.74858027718852,"ท่าอากาศยานสุวรรณภูมิ, สป.2001, แขวงลาดกระบัง, เขตลาดกระบัง, บ้านหัวคู้, ตำบลศีรษะจรเข้น้อย, องค์การบริหารส่วนตำบลศีรษะจรเข้น้อย, อำเภอบางเสาธง, กรุงเทพมหานคร, 10520, ประเทศไทย"

Paul Bryde,,LHR to ATH,1,Not Verified,by far the worst cabin crew,"Verified Review   I am a regular traveller on many airlines and a One World Emerald FF. British Airways flight BA632 from LHR to Athens on 11th September was by far the worst cabin crew that I have encountered in 45 years of flying. The crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in Business Class, and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area. After 1.5 hours in the air, we were offered a drink, the champagne was undrinkable, and the crew gave me a gin and tonic. After that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible. That was all the service we received on the whole flight of 3.5 hours. No top up of drinks no offer of water, and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking. I even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft, and received no reply",Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow,,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",37.9372535,23.95462175657147,"Διεθνής Αερολιμένας Αθηνών «Ελευθέριος Βενιζέλος», Κορωπί - Αεροδρόμιο, Κοινότητα Σπάτων - Λούτσας, Δημοτική Ενότητα Σπάτων - Λούτσας, Δήμος Σπάτων - Αρτέμιδος, Περιφερειακή Ενότητα Ανατολικής Αττικής, Περιφέρεια Αττικής, Αποκεντρωμένη Διοίκηση Αττικής, 190 19, Ελλάς"

Was given Pay-in lounge access and this was better than nothing but I wonder why they couldn't have just given me access to their lounge. I decided to give them a chance since avoiding BA/QF flying between Australia and Europe but I never will again. Pay to reserve seats? Pay to request meal? I guess BA is positioning itself as a budget airline, but its price doesn't reflect that yet. It's a shame as I enjoy the transit through Singapore rather than the gulf states.

Again I had to call BA 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight. 2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junk-fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound. The second call was to get a refund and rebook the junk-fee. The third call was to complain about spending 2-hours checking in and correcting BA's mistakes. I spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee. The BA lounge at TXL is small and does not have a toilet.

Generous luggage and hand luggage allowance, even more so by being One World Sapphire member, which also allowed pre-booking of seats (including emergency exit row) at no charge and lounge access. So far so good, but new style leather seats (whilst smart looking) are hard after 3 hours flying without the ability to recline. No entertainment apart from BA in flight Magazine and inflight shopping magazine. What really lets British Airways down, though is the food and beverage service. One (albeit fresh) sandwich and a drink. No tea or coffee service and the crew fast became invisible after the meal had been served. The flight was crowded too, meaning that overhead luggage space was at a premium as the negative effects of a generous hand luggage policy came into play.

The Business Class lounges in LHR are often very busy, the food isn't very good, although they provide a load of free pouring alcohol.! The Club World cabin on the Boeing 787 is very nice place (although a bit crammed). The cabin design and atmosphere retains a feeling of class. In terms of the Club World seat, it has its critics, but I like it! The separate footrest is one of the best features for making a comfortable seating position, and its one of the only airline seats I can sleep in. This may in part be due to knowing there aren't many things to distract you from sleeping such as a bar area or a huge range of films on the IFE. Food wise, its an o' affair. The dishes are ok, although you only get the choice of dessert or cheese not both, how cheapskate!

Juan Carlos Toffano,July 2016,MXP to MEX via LHR,1,Not Verified,extremely disappointed,"I'm extremely disappointed with British Airways and how their service has diminished. My daughter arrived at Milan airport today to catch a 6am flight to London Heathrow and then connecting to Mexico City. She is still at the airport after 12 hours. The fligth to London was cancelled. There was only one person at the counter in Milan and no employee told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation. Customers were furious, screaming at the lonely representative, because British Airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem. My daughter missed her flight, was not offered a meal, a hotel room and only given the option to fly with Iberia through Madrid and then connect to Mexico City. Her bag was sent to a distant belt and was never told she had to pick it up and retrieve her luggage. This has been a total disaster. I had also paid for a good seat on her long flight to Mexico City, and now I will have to write and complain and wait for a refund. British Airways was an excellent airline, until suddenly everything changed. On my last trip my bag never arrived at Heathrow, I was given a short connection time therefore I lost my next flight. I encountered a very rude lady at the customer service counter and I had to stay at Heathrow to get the same flight 24 hours later.

Owain Cartledge,,GVA to LHR,2,Not Verified,not worth it on every level,"Verified Review   
The British Airways Club Europe (Business) product is dreadful value for money. The lounge in Geneva airport was fine but busy as previous flights had been delayed. Boarding wasn't done by priority, just a free for all at the gate - fine but nothing special. My real issue is with the offering on-board: no special seats, just the middle seat of three left free. We were then served a 'meal' of a few lettuce leaves, two tomatoes, two bits of cheese and a piece of chicken - really BA? To top it off we were on a remote stand at Heathrow and it took a long time to get the transfer bus to us.

R Lloyd,,LHR to JFK,1,Not Verified,standards have dropped dramatically,British Airways standards have dropped dramatically. My flight from Heathrow to New York JFK was awful. Passengers were not given a hand towel or a menu before the dinner service. I was only given one choice of meal. The interior of the aircraft looked worn and shoddy (there was litter on the ground when entering the aircraft) with the onboard entertainment system on the aircraft outdated to say the least (there were limited choices available and the screen which was scratched kept flickering throughout the flight). Even the blanket and pillow looked as though it had had too many washes. The exterior of the aircraft was also dirty and unkept. Staff on board appeared far from athletic.

H Layton,,LHR to EWR,10,Not Verified,seat was really comfortable,"Verified Review   London Heathrow to Newark return. Having just returned from my holiday, flying with British Airways in their World Traveller Plus class, I thought I would post my review. The week before we flew, we paid the £48 per person to select our seats so I had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. We flew out of T5 at LHR one what I think is one of BA’s new 787 to Newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and clean. We took our seats 21 J and K which were right next to the toilets. On our seats we found a small pillow, blanket, headphones and an amenity kit. I had plenty of leg room (ok, I am 5’5) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (he is 5’10). Although our seats were next to the toilets, we didn’t get disturbed movement or smells. Once the curtain was pulled between us and World Traveller, you wouldn’t have known we were by the bathrooms. We were offered a glass of something fizzy – water and juice were also available. Hot towels were handed out. Menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken, with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with cheese and biscuits. The food was ok, it was hot and tasted good. The food service was quick, and prior to the food served, drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. However, during food service another drink was also offered. So, three small bottles of wine for the flight and I was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. As we didn’t have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. As there was a wall behind us, we couldn’t recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enough. Luckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn’t really recline theirs too far. The seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, I felt I had plenty of room. Although I had loaded up my tablet with films and books, I didn’t use it at all. Neither did I use the vast choice of IFE – I used to 6.5hour flight time to have some “me” time. My partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. After food, the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. Most people (me included) took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. A sandwich and small chocolate bar, tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up (in my seat). The pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. I quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending 10 or more minutes in there – whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. However, the toilets were clean. The landing was smooth and we arrived on time – I suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don’t the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early? On leaving the plane I did have a look at Business Class, and without offending regular Business Class users, I did wonder exactly what you get for your money.

N Ashton,,LGW to FAO,1,Not Verified,flight was late and chaotic,"Verified Review   For those who have alluded to there being ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" on BA flights in terms of customer service I can assure them this is not the case. I am a gold executive club member and can confirm that I have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins. My last experience was with my wife flying from London Gatwick to Faro on the 18 May 2016. Checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful BA employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight. The lounges that are available whilst the BA lounges are renovated were packed and filthy. The BA lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn’t access the clubrooms that were full. The flight was late and chaotic. A group of loud boisterous men, were virtually running the economy cabin, roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits. This resulted in my Wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic. It turned out to be a lie when the Purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a G&T on a tray. Returned home 10 days later and complained. Received a jumbled response.

K Johnson,June 2016,LAS to LHR,3,Not Verified,did not have a good experience,"Las Vegas to London Heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with British Airways. Both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything I've ever experienced flying on any other airline. I tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but I was uncomfortably hot the whole time. My husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. On our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. I thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! A group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. They had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. They were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. A couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. This poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. The boarding process in Las Vegas was smooth, but boarding at Heathrow was a joke. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. As a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. It made boarding take forever.

After changing the return flight we opted to travel A380 to Singapore. Very pleased to say that overall the experience was excellent, the Premium Economy product on this aircraft is fantastic. Seat pitch, entertainment unit, overall comfort was good. The food was ok but I think attention to detail is lacking to polish off this product. 1st meal you receive has metal cutlery yet the second meal is plastic. Only a minor negative.

The food was just appalling. I could hardly get two mouthfuls our of my starter and the main course (beef) was hard, tasteless and very small. Compared to business class meals in say Cathay Pacific or Qatar Airways, portions on both starter and main were around 50% less. Incredibly, British Airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, I was hungry after the meal so later on decided to 'raid the larder' but they only had sweet, which I generally avoid. The menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available. The FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheese. Plus were excellent service, good selection of IFE and comfortable enough seats (a larger pillow would do), although I hate having to climb over someone to get out of my seat.

The exception is British Airways. In January, 2016 I booked a flight for two passengers on BA in Business Class from San Francisco to London and back for travel in May/June. Seats in Business Class are not assigned until 48 hours before flight time. However, and here comes another BA first: If you want to choose your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee. I ended up shelling out $484 - for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flight. This on top of the steep fare charged for travel in Business Class.

Bought my ticket using British Airways miles and their part of the trip did not disappoint. The flight from Pisa to London Heathrow on an A320, was flawless. The check-in was normal, flight was fine, there were IFE and food and beverages served. I proceeded to my next flight, which was operated by American Airlines. Boarding was on time, which is the only positive thing about this flight. The seats are old, IFE had no selection of movies, when I searched for action and adventure there was only one film! How was I supposed to stay entertained on an 8 hour plus flight if there aren't any movies? The food was awful, and the best thing I can say is they gave lots of drinks. The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear about my problems. There was no way to sit comfortably and I dreaded the flight since the moment my foot stepped aboard the plane. Arrived ahead of schedule, another positive thing. Once I cleared security I found that there is a British Airways flight, actually operated by British Airways, that arrives at the same time.

Gerard Dunne,,LGW to AMS,2,Not Verified,bumped off this BA flight,"London Gatwick to Amsterdam. I was bumped off this British Airways flight as a result of a change of plane, to an A319 I gather. The process was not well handled, and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority, although others also missed out I understand. The main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (I had to bus from Gatwick to Heathrow), and poor follow-up when I queried matters afterwards. BA refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. I checked with a friend who's a UK privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be a refusal by BA to respond. I also raised the transfer with BA, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant I missed a transfer bus. Better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on any service that day, with BA to arrange it so with the bus company. On the positive side, I was compensated per the rules, and did make a BA flight later that day, which was OK. Nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and I'm afraid British Airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick,Amsterdam - Amsterdam Airport Schiphol,,51.1541082,-0.1823116499127204,"London Gatwick Airport, Perimeter Road East, Lowfield Heath, Crawley, West Sussex, England, RH6 0JJ, United Kingdom",52.32697895,4.741505200022974,"Luchthaven Schiphol, Badhoevedorp, Haarlemmermeer, Noord-Holland, Nederland, 1171 VM, Nederland"

John O Connor,,DOH to LHR via BAH,4,Not Verified,would avoid again,"Doha to London via Bahrain with British Airways, and a very poor lounge in Doha. Even flying First Class on BA there is no reciprocal arrangement to access the excellent Qatar Airways Lounge. Instead there is a lounge for all other airlines. On boarding my wife and I were ushered to our seats. And to our amazement our individual lockers were opened by the flight attendants who promptly disappeared without making an offer to hang our coats or jackets, as is standard practice on even business class. No hot towels before take off or landing, very average menu, and as we slept through dinner were keen on breakfast. Told that due to possible turbulence coffee could not be prepared, both our cutlery earlier wrapped by the crew were delivered without spoons to eat the very soggy muesli. Orange juice tropics a quality. We had to ask for marmalade with our toast. All the crew displayed little perception of customer needs, made the more marked by Qatar Airways Business class crew who were absolutely excellent on the earlier Sydney to Doha Flight. Poor food, very poor crew awareness, or attention to detail, who seemed to be going through the motions. Slightly aloof. Way below the 3 Gulf majors in flight attention. However bed was very good, as you would expect. Amenity kit below the Qatar Airways Business class kit, and a joke in comparison to Qatars First class kit.

J Lawrence,,SEA to JNB via LHR,7,Not Verified,overall experience was pleasant,"Verified Review   British Airways from Seattle to Johannesburg via London Heathrow. First leg SEA to LHR was on a 747. The plane was satisfactory to me. I don't understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. Not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. I sat in one of the ""twosomes"" (seat 52A) in the tail. The food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointment. I would buy seat 52A again if I was traveling on a British Airways 747, but be advised there is no wall next to 52A that you can lean on to sleep. Second leg was on an A380. I sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82A. This time, the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11+ hours of the flight. The A380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. The upper cabin on an A380 is amazingly quiet. The food on this leg was far better with an English breakfast served prior to landing in Jo-burg. I would not play for seat 82A again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82A that limit foot room, but I would play for seat 82B, which is an aisle seat. IFE on both legs was pretty sad but I'm not one for popular culture. Cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. BA ground personnel at Heathrow were very nice and helpful. I've traveled between South Africa and North America about a dozen times over the past two years.

Barry Dennis,,LHR to CPT,2,Not Verified,no entertainment,"First time my partner and I have flown British Airways for some years and we will not be returning after our flight from London Heathrow to Cape Town. I booked the flights several months before and had to pay £40 to pre-select our seats both ways (£160). On both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was not working. Attempts by staff to re-boot the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no entertainment. On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a previous passenger must have ""bounced a child on it."" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed egg and bacon. When asked if I could have a Continental equivalent, all I got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired. We had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat.

The seats are comfortable and are OK as long as you do not have a seat where someone has to step over you or you have to step over someone else. The inflight entertainment system uses a dual prong plug in for their inflight entertainment system so I had to use their headphones which are not comfortable for long periods of time. After going outside of airport security for a long layover at LHR and coming back through the security process, BA tried to make my wife check in her carry-on bag which she has used in our travels on many airlines around the world without question - and was already accepted on our first leg from Seattle. Her bag fit in BA's measurement gage frame, but the BA desk agent did not like how I put it in. Apparently it has to not only fit, but it can only be placed in the gage with a straight up and down motion only. After complaining that her requirement was unnecessary, the desk agent relented in a huff. BA also required that I pay to chose my seats after buying a 7000 USD business class ticket. I am a Alaska MVP Gold member so I can fly BA as a partner airline and get mileage credit, but I cannot book seats without paying.

There is a privacy screen, but if you are not travelling with a friend or family member you'll be looking at a complete stranger for the duration of your flight. The cabin crew have to stretch over the person in the aisle seat to serve drinks and meals.

James Deverick,,BKK to LHR,4,Not Verified,won't be using BA again,"Bangkok to London Heathrow on British Airways. I have lived in Thailand for 4 years now and try to go back to the UK at least once a year to visit family and friends. Normally, I fly either Emirates to Manchester or to Heathrow with EVA Air. This time around, BA came up with a fairly competitive price. The aircraft wasn't in particularly impressive shape and in-flight entertainment unit was quite outdated and didn't work for the first 2 hours of the flight. Once it did work, the screen was awful and very dark. I can't fathom why BA are using outdated entertainment systems when rivals such as EVA, Emirates and even Thai Airways are much more current. Inflight service was okay for the most part. Regular trips by the staff for refreshments in the first few hours, but this certainly died down afterwards. After using the call system to get the attention of a staff member, I was abruptly asked to switch it off and asked if I had a problem. No problem, just would like a drink please. However, alcohol (apart from wine) had ran out. I'm not a massive drinker, but do have a couple of whiskey and cokes on a flight. Also, there was no Wi-Fi, no charge points for mobile devices. This is again in contrast with Emirates, Thai Airways and EVA. All in all,  I have to say it was a disappointing experience.

And then they'll lose your bag, tell you it's going to take 4-5 days to get it to you and provide no information about what to do in the meantime.

I travel regularly in business class on Emirates, normally on the same equipment.

In addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangements and although were fine with me, were mildly irritated with the requests of other passengers, openly commenting to each other in front of me. The cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired, after only a couple of hours into the flight, the toilets were disgusting with the floor awash - I don't think crew check them on a regular basis. The window seat has side stowage facilities, which in my case had a disgusting pale yellow fluid and rubbish in it.

Sylvia Goddard,,LHR to DXB,7,Not Verified,out of date with modern standards,"This review covers my usual return trip from London Heathrow to Dubai. Both flights are overnight and I use points to upgrade to business. It was a Boeing 777 going out and Boeing 747 on the return trip. There was nothing really wrong with either flight but I only really use them for the timings and the flat bed to get some sleep. I don't like the weird front to back 2x4x2 layout and cannot forsee how much longer British Airways can get away with this as it is so out of date with modern standards. It is fine if you get a window seat and no one attached to you. Having watched the seating pattern filling up over several months I eventually paid £136 extra to reserve a window seat both ways. After a couple of hours the bed is very hard and the storage is almost non existent. That said, the crew were polite and served well. They seemed to be older and I think that makes the difference, they understand customer service. On the return, one cabin crew in particular was very responsive and helpful in offering tea mid flight. Overall the product is outdated and this time the service was good. It got me there and back safely and I was fed and watered. I am very open to moving my custom elsewhere though, primarily due to the seat layout.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow,,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",25.2521287,55.365715576690505,"مطار دبي الدولي, شارع 1, القرهود, دبي, الإمارات العربية المتحدة"

British Airways lounge at Heathrow and Spa very nice as was breakfast served there. Lounge at Houston is far too small, so many 'status' holders in there that it became standing room only. Outbound plane we were due to fly on went 'tech' 45 mins before departure so swapped and after delay of 2 hours they got a 'new' plane. Sadly neither plane nor interior were new. The 'new first' First class seats ageing badly, grubby and scuffed, seat electrics hesitant to work at times and old entertainment system that failed during the flight. Interior much better on the way back. Crew excellent and attentive on way out. Food well presented but poor outbound, better coming back, wine same both ways and rather average. Surprised the hand baggage allowance is same in all classes now, In First class you have an entire overhead to yourself and seat storage, so why not allow First passengers to make use of it?. Priority baggage labelling as always pointless - came out in the middle of everyone elses. The simple question to ask is was it worth it - if I had paid for it, a no.

Stephen Riches,,BKK to LHR,3,Not Verified,Business seats are horrid,"Roundtrip with British Airways from Bangkok to London in Club World. Really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. The seats are horrid. Cramped and you feel like you're in a coffin if you have the backward-facing window seats. It's unbelievably cramped and when I pay more than 4x the economy ticket, I expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed-mode. The main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned.  The pre-ordered beef on the inbound was dry. Changed it for the cold King prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. The bathrooms are hideous and there's no distinction between economy and business. Blocked washbasin, tissue fibres all over the place, stained walls and peeling finishes. Crew outbound were older and very pleasant. Inbound was a much younger crew and only one (Spanish lady) was truly aware of passenger needs. The rest were more intent on getting to Bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. Boarding at LHR they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin, chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye-contact after entering the door. The Club Word lounge meal offerings at T5 were abysmal. More like a school canteen. If anyone from BA reads these opinions, then please do something about your dreadful IFE.

I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped. My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. Later I tried mine (no one behind me) and, the same, it would not recline. Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person.

She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline.

I was never give a choice of desserts but found a piece of pie on my tray along with the starter and steak. I was never offered coffee and had to stop an attendant and ask for some. I was not offered any after dinner drink. In short, the service was rushed and more like a coach class.

It cost £1,010.06 which is a bargain for a direct business class return from Heathrow to Tokyo. The lounge at Heathrow was not crowded and boarding was prompt. I had pre booked my seat, rear facing by the window. I was sitting comfortably when a Japanese gentleman arrived and told me I was sitting in his seat. I told him it was my seat. I asked to see his boarding pass which was for my seat. I showed him my electronic boarding pass which was for the same seat. At this stage the Purser was passing and we raised the issue. I decided to stand my ground as I was happy with my pre booked seat. The Purser went away to investigate. When he returned, he apologised for the error and quietly asked me to follow him and said I would not be disappointed.

Jason Duckling,,London to Phoenix,7,Not Verified,keep expectations in check,"The 747 is definitely showing it's age. Nonetheless it was comfortable. Pre take off drinks offered included water, OJ or sparkling wine. BA also gives the option of pre-ordering your choice of main course online so although I did notice they ran out of choice towards the end of the service I had received my beef. I advise anyone in First/Business/World Traveller Plus to use this facility. World traveller Plus is definitely an 'enhanced economy' versus some airlines premium economy which is more a 'business minus'. So keep expectations in check. You get a bigger seat, pre take off drink, little amenity kit and a slightly upgraded meal. However, considering that I paid only £170 per sector on top of the usual World Traveller (economy) fare it was worth every penny in my eye. Would I pay a crazy supplement for this class of travel?

Seats are too cramped, compared to other airlines, no storage space apart from a small draw to store a laptop. A plastic privacy screen is all that separated me from the person in the aisle seat and that had to be lowered and raised when cabin crew served meals and drinks. When the aisle seat was made into flat bed, I had to climb over person to use bathroom etc. This could be a problem for less mobile passengers.

The new First product is excellent. The service was greatthe seats comfortable, inflight entertainment very good, and the food was well presented, with a good choice of wines. I slept well, and actually enjoyed the journey - one I do very regularly on other carriers but chose BA this time for a change. Bags were tagged as priority but in Sydney they came out after about 120 other pieces of luggage, meaning I nearly missed my onward connection to Melbourne. Staff gossip in the galleys - it's a flimsy curtain and I don't want to hear about staff boyfriend troubles, holiday plans, or crew roster. Cleanliness of the toilets is the responsibility of the staff to monitor, but in First the toilets are too cramped, and I ended up wiping the toilet floor myself with tissues and sanitary wipes because I didn't know what that liquid on the floor was. While safety and the journey are the most important things, it's these ""Attention to detail"" items that make or break the service experience.

They only want to get you off the phone as quick as they can and keep apologising that they are so busy! I have emailed them and had 5 generic emails back no resolution, worst is they are from 5 different people who clearly have not read the notes from previous emails, I have had two phone calls following tweets - all they tried to do was sell me something and had no idea that I was trying to complain.

On this flight one flight attendant hit me twice with his cabin trolley and did not even excuse himself. The aircraft and the seats in Premium Economy are quite good including food and drinks.  But the worst with BA is customer support and help with problems. On my outbound flight from PHL to LHR I had a problem with reserving a seat. Although it was shown as free in the map (no bassinet!) I was not able to select it. First time calling the customer support I was told this is a technical error. Second time the lady told me that this is not bookable as this is next to a bassinet. Then one day later is was reserved. I called again and they told me that I was too late. Any hint on my two other calls was answered with ""that's your problem. You have a seat what is the problem?"". I mean at least she is right but the attitude is extremely bad and maybe there is a reason why I want to have this seat.

No room under the seat to store handbag. Seats appear to be smaller. When person in row in front of me reclined, I had minimal room to move or to access my purse. Little attention from cabin attendants. Told them I was getting dizzy from lack of cool air, and they allowed me to move to seat in galley where air was cooler from Business Class seats. Food served was terrible. No advance menu to choose from. No individual lighting or air. I thought it was my worst experience until immigration 2.5 hour wait in line to clear immigration / customs. Our prepaid taxi waited 90 minutes and then left. Horrible experience. The return flight was worse.

The inflight entertainment is constantly faulty and breaking - they had to keep resetting it (this has happened on the last two BA Club flights I have been on), the seats are tired, it was not very clean - the lockers by the windows on the upper deck were dirty and falling apart. The food was quite good except the dessert was awful - they always seem to serve the same lemon dessert on this leg. The crew were pleasant, but the planes are too old and tired now to make this an attractive option.

The aircraft interiors were shabby at best, seats uncomfortable, IFE hopeless, food awful. Cabin crew were mixed, one or two fairly pleasant but most going about their duties in a perfunctory way. One male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly.

The flight to Cape Town was however a different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. The economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move, and I'm only 5'10 tall. The seat back entertainment screens must be first generation, tiny screen with a grid of lines on it, I've seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties, apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and I quote ""her guests"" and who made the flight a bit more bearable. The food on offer was standard economy class fare, it filled a gap, just. The flight time for BA0059 is 11.5 hours, so British Airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room, and better catering for economy class passengers, who do make up the majority of people on board, not the premium passengers.

My wife tried the ""breakfast"" - a dried up sausage and disgusting scrambled eggs. She declared she would not give it to our dog Charlie, a cocker spaniel. The boarding gate was miles away and BA shipped us over to gate in a golf buggy. It took ages! Apparently they are installing a First lounge later this year, the same story I heard at LAX last year. The flight left on time. FAs were terrific and it seems BA rely on crew to make or break every flight nowadays. The seat was much better than outbound on a Boeing 747. Food okay - starter of ""dried"" Asian duck was fantastic. Soup very good. Grilled salmon okay - a bit dry. Wines very good and chilled properly, which is often not the case. Only four passengers in First - including my wife and I. It wasn't too bad - but there is no wow factor.

Marcus Hoellrich,,Denver to London,1,Not Verified,our last flight with British Airways,"I can confirm what has been reported earlier about British Airways long haul flights. Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same. The TV screen was almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an IKEA couch from the 1970's. The usual food choice of ""pasta or chicken"" was reduced to chicken only. On top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the UK. Disaster at the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation - British Airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. Hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist! We had to find a room for 4 (two small kids) on our own at almost midnight.

I asked 3 times for the agent to link the booking, which she did. BA computer did not perform properly so we were seated apart.

Yvonne Attridge,August 2015,London Gatwick to Rome Fiumicino,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"What on earth has happened to British Airways inflight meals? On our way out to Rome, we were told that the plane had to be changed, so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it I thought well, OK, maybe the reason for that is because of the change of planes so no hot meals available. However, on our return, not only did we have an hour delay (still not sure why that happened, we were traveling with a 1 year old baby, so it was quite stressful just waiting around), but on our flight our ""meal"" was half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and  lettuce, they said chicken was in it, but I didn't have any in mine. That was it, no hot drink either, the drinks trolley did come round once so we were then offered a soft drink, or there were small spirits if you wanted them but the food was appalling.

John Simonyan,,London to Nassau,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Where shall I start, 4 hours delay or the days without my luggage? I came to Nassau for my wedding, me, my wife and our 3 best friends. We arrived to Nassau on Tuesday with 4 hours delay, but the most annoying part just begun. Our wedding was on Friday, me and my wife were without luggage until Thursday, due to hell knows what was going on in BA, my best mate, didn't receive his luggage for a week, and on my wedding he was best man, so I had to give him cloths to wear. We had to change the organized wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day arrival, BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day, and that was for me 3 days, my friend 1 week. When I received my bag, they lost my key, that I gave in airport in Nassau to BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. They lost my key and I had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained. Me and my wife slept half flight, but when we woke up, the cabin crew told us that we can't have warm food anymore - we had 3 hours to fly, and  we were hungry.

However, due to a power failure at Heathrow our luggage did not make it on our flight. I was appalled to see that there was no back up at all in the first place, but then we were told our baggage would be with us within two days by one of British Airways staff. It is now nearly our fourth day on holiday and we still have not got our bags. I understand that this happens and sometimes is inevitable, but I am most dissatisfied by the information British Airways are able to provide us about our bags. All we know is that they have left Heathrow; we don't know which airport they were flown to, if they arrived, where they are or when we can expect them. They have no details of any individual bags and I think this is disgusting service.

Why does BA put these awful tables in? Nobody uses them and when I complained to BA, I was told ""don't sit in a window seat"" - what sort of Customer Relations is that.

We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite on time, though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem.

Flight was late, usual excuse of late arrival from a previous flight. Flight deck crew affable. Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight.

,July 2015,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Let me just start off by saying that I'm an educator, and I have the patience of a saint. This being said, after my first flight with BA when my luggage stayed in Tampa and didn't make it to the UK until four days after I'd arrived, I stayed fairly calm. Mistakes are made. My flight had been canceled (which seems like commonplace at BA), and was re-booked after only three hours on the phone. When I ventured to take my trip home, I was notified via text message that my flight had been canceled yet again. After speaking to a calm man about my horrible experience thus far, he informed me of a customer care number that I could call and complain about my flight. Let's remember I'm a teacher, and I also payed $1,800 for this trip. That's an entire months pay just so we all know. I'm meant to leave tomorrow and still have not received confirmation via email.

Edwin Ng,,London to Singapire,6,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Flight was decent. Have to say the seat was rather cramp. I'm 180cm, or 5 foot 9, sat at seat 32F. Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. It damages easily if it gets caught on something. I had to change 2 headsets because of that, because being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. Service was alright. I requested for eye shades, and it came about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In terms of food, it was appalling and greasy. Overall, I will not say never again, but given a choice, I'd look out for Singapore Airlines first, then the big 3 Gulf carriers.

Darran Burr,,LHR to KUL,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Having read many reviews on here I was somewhat sceptical about flying Club World with BA, however, I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort, service and overall experience that we enjoyed on this 13 hour flight to Kuala Lumpur. We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover of the new A380.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow,,,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",2.748372,101.69325937891328,"Lapangan Terbang Antarabangsa Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, 64000, Malaysia"

Pauline James,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"I was amazed that this airline charges extra to book a seat in advance. I have never seen that on any of the non-discount carriers, especially in business class. When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out.

John Gray,,LHR to Grand Cayman via Nassau,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"It appears BA continues to adopt a “do as little as possible” for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up. Post-flight I found the BA customer complaints dept to be dreadful, and left me far more disappointed with the service than at the end of my flights.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow,Grand Cayman,Nassau,51.46773895,-0.4587800741571181,"London Heathrow Airport, The Beacon Roundabout, London Borough of Hillingdon, London, Greater London, England, TW6 3JF, United Kingdom",19.3298691,-81.17122907994889,"Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands"

We were in Club Europe (new seat design) in row #1. I am glad we were as rows 2,3 etc looked very cramped. The only difference with economy being the table tray in the centre - instead of a seat. Lunch was very good indeed. I had the Thai chicken - my wife had the cheeks of beef which she said was excellent. FAs were very friendly. Smooth flight all the way.

When I tried to check online the system did not allow me to do online check-in. I called the BA contact center in the UK and was shocked with the response received. The person told me that there is a difference between confirmed booking and confirmed seating. Essentially BA wants to sell their seats at a premium. They arm twist the passengers and make lame excuses that although you have confirmed flight bookings it doesn't mean you can fly unless you get the seats allocation.

The plane was parked in a no-mans area and we were bussed to the plane. To my horror I had to climb through the stairs with my carry on bag! The width of the seat and the leg space is the smallest I saw in my 40 years of travel experience. It's a shame that that the airline is using this kind of carrier for a Transatlantic flight. The quality of food is one of the worst I have ever seen. I picked the non-veg chicken item the taste and content was hopeless. The container was marked for expiry as 28/11/16 07.53 an expiry after 18 months but marked for the hour and minute.

George Ling,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew to Tampa from Gatwick on the 12/5/15 return flight on the 25/5/15. Had flown with BA on several occasions to Mauritius. Can't believe despite the number of complaints BA received nothing has changed regarding the food the service. Admittedly some of crew are good but some of them makes you wonder why did they choose such career. BA seriously need to review the customer care they provide. Dinner overcooked frozen rolls with a cereal bar for breakfast - really tasted better food on cheaper airline. Come on BA listen to your customer and improve your service.

Grant Cooper,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Club World: Just flown London Gatwick to Las Vegas in Club World and very disappointed. Staff were not particularly helpful gave the impression that everything they did they were doing you a favour. The seating of 2/4/2 in a Business Cabin is unfair trying to pack too many people in. They didn't offer anything to try to make you feel a bit special and I had paid a lot of money for the tickets. I normally fly Virgin Atlantic on this route and will defiantly be using them in the future.,Unknown,Unknown,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

From the start of the return trip we experienced problems. Headset failed to work on reporting this to the cabin crew I was informed that ""you need to jiggle it to make a connection"" so needed to unpack my own kit to watch a movie. Meal time the only choice left was pasta one with cheese and one without the passenger next to me had the pasta it looked like it had been re-heated with the cover off very hard. On mentioning it to the cabin staff all she got was ""their cutting down"" in all areas. Re the movie this picture quality was a disgrace picture and sound kept braking up I switched my phone on and again used my own music to get me through the 8 hours trip.

Alistair Baker,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I treated myself to Premium Economy on my PEK-LHR flight BA38 because it was only an extra £120 and I had been on holiday to North Korea and wanted a bit of luxury. I was impressed with the legroom in the bulkhead seat and the PE cabin was not very full. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and the food was good however it seemed to be the same as the Economy food just with a fancy menu card. I was impressed with the seat recline and the footrest and I got a lot of sleep even though it was a daytime flight. The IFE malfunctioned for the first half of the flight which seems a common occurrence on BA 747s. Staff were apologetic and gave us complaint forms to fill in.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Nick Rego,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,First off this particular flight from EWR to LHR and back was advertised as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The actual jet was a 777 much less comfortable. The flight going to London was 3 hours delayed coming into EWR something about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in Boston MA. In fact they had not allocated a crew. Coming home my pre-paid seats were changed in premium economy to seats next to W'C's so I had the pleasure of smelling excretion and gas the whole flight. I was also emailed an offer for an upgrade then that email was followed up with one that stated that the first one was sent in error. Fact: I did get back to the USA. Reality: BA no more - never again. The problem with BA is not their cabin crews who are quite nice. The problem is that their Customer service is a joke.

So one is acceptable - two is well a co-incidence. (or not). Left 90 minutes late (about 20 minutes) after the earlier late departure got stacked over Kent - landing about 2 hours late - from a 80 minutes flight. Plane was almost brand new.

David Ellis,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LGW-HER. A320 on one of BA's new tourist-orientated routes. Sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the penny-pinching 'new' Club Europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. If this is the way BA are going it doesn't make sense to pay the extra.

Damon Goodman,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"LGW-RAK-LGW May 2015. These flights were on BA's newly configured A320's we paid for Emergency Exit row seats on both ways and very thankful that we did British Airways have reduced the legroom in both Economy & Business class to 30"" and at 6'1 the normal legroom now is quite tight. The seats themselves are quite comfortable and having storage at the top of the seats mean you don't lose your legroom. The service on board was excellent friendly staff both ways provided with a wrap roll cheese and biscuits and a chocolate mousse both ways return not as nice as outbound and they offer complimentary drinks. Looking at business class all you get is the middle seat free and no extra legroom a lounge and a hot meal so wouldn't think it's worth the upgrade fee anymore (having travelled many times in club with BA new product is not a winner from what I could see). I would fly British Airways again and would recommend them.",Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

W Coenik,,,10,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Business class. Scheduled to fly from Rome to Gatwick on 7 May on BA2543. The day that the fire broke out at Rome airport. We had a 12.45pm flight. I received a text from BA at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact BA. I called them and they rebooked us on flight BA555 at 8.15pm but direct to Heathrow. We accepted the flight change considering and lounged around Rome for the morning. Than when about to get the train to Rome airport received a text from BA advise that flight had been changed to Naples and if we wanted that flight to make our way to Naples. So we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in Naples. The flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to Naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to Naples. I think the communication and the effect that BA did to get us out of Rome under the circumstances was excellent. A friend was flying to Paris from Rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was not to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. Once on board in Euro Business class it was all pamper. The meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and BBQ style prawns. Finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely Spanish white. Once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went. So well down BA for what I know for others turned out to be a nightmare.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Boarding was easy friendly cabin crew was waiting for us to take jackets. Hot towels tasting breakfast landed on time. This short flight 10/10. Security in Heathrow was horror but I prefer the horror of waiting than the horror of terror. First lounge was a breeze. Boarding for the flight to Toronto was with busses driving us to the Dreamliner. Indeed the business seats are smaller. It really felt bad. The flight was not comfortable at all as I left the plane with pain in the back and shoulder. The crew were excellent the food was excellent and the screens are improved. But the space you have is really a shame. As a gold member I fly often business or first but the club world seats in the Dreamliner are really smaller and not comfortable at all.

From start to finish of the flight they ensured that all passengers in Club Europe received the upmost service. Although the 767 is starting to show some age I prefer this version of the Club Europe seats compared to the new configuration which is being rolled out on their Airbuses. At least the seats on the 767 are comfortable & there is plenty of space between the rows compared the the new version which has the same pitch as economy. The catering was good with a great choice of meals to select from the service was speedy and accommodating too with their drinks etc..,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

R Stuart,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,We flew Premium Economy class from Singapore to London on a 747 carrier. It was a waste of money. The plane looked 100 years old and nothing seemed to work properly. The entertainment system remote control was stuck to its base and it had to be removed with a sharp instrument. The little screen showed a blurred picture so it was not worth watching movies. The crew was nowhere to be seen and they couldn''t be called if you needed something because the call button had been cancelled on all remote controls. At some stage I went to the toilet and went through the kitchen. The crew was there talking and laughing and one of them was sitting reading the paper. Shame on you BA.

Nicolas Simonis,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,For my annual trip ATH-PHL via any European city (dep 18/3 return 19/4) this time I chose BA because they were the cheapest. This was my first flight on BA to the USA. Soon after my choice I tried to select a seat as far front as possible however I was asked to pay 35 euros for a seat in row. 27. 35 euros and you are almost at the end of the aircraft. In the end BA was more expensive than others. The flight was ok and punctual B777 not really my choice as very noisy staff service - one hostess was excellent another was ignorant and unwilling. Food the usual Penne Rigate. Complained to BA via email however no reply was ever received. For my return flight I was in row 30 same noisy B777 same Penne Rigate and of course a good choice of inflight entertainment. Breakfast with lovely frozen bread roll. Yes frozen or chilled. My next choice will of course not be BA.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Outward leg was excellent with good food and great cabin service. On the return leg the lady in front fully reclined her seat immediately after take off and went to sleep leaving me with just about the same cramped space as you have in Economy. Even during meal service cabin crew did nothing to alleviate the situation. Very disappointed with this aspect and also with the breakfast.

Bob Motto,,,10,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Club Europe LHR-AMS. The boarding process was a joke we had to take the bus to our aircraft. In the boarding lounge they asked for all Club Europe and Gold and Silver to come forward and board the bus then they let all of the remaining passengers board the bus which made priority boarding a total joke. They should follow the same process when flights land at a remote stand and have a separate bus just for use by Club Europe passengers at least when departing Club Europe passengers would enjoy their priority boarding. I understand there is a need for on time departures but BA really need to ensure that where priority boarding is taking place their Club Passenger receive it.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Are fooling no-one with their new Club Europe Business Class seats - they look nice - but are too close together providing extremely poor legroom! As a regular London to Geneva traveller I will go back to flying Swiss! The decision to change this is almost as bad as the stupid decision to have seats facing backwards in Club World where you have to face strangers and climb over others to get to your seat.

Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Lynn Ryder,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,We flew for the very first time on BA on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. Our holiday to St Lucia from Gatwick was booked through Kuoni and we usually fly with Virgin Atlantic. We always upgrade with Virgin to Premium Economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the Premium Economy Experience with Virgin is very good. Therefore we booked BA World Traveller Plus expecting the same degree of service. What a disappointment! I would not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting the larger luggage allowance BA World Traveller Plus is almost exactly the same as World Traveller. The Service both ways was appalling! The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight! We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all. On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. We only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. On this length of flight I was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and Were asleep throughout the 9 hours. The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything. The aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade.

J Rose,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,BA 208 MIA-LHR in Club. Leg four of a seven leg BA adventure. Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. Moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than BA.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Large TVs even bigger selection of films/TV shows/games and the usual good free food (shepherd's pie) and drink (red wine and beer). Comfy seats with plenty of leg room (and I'm over six foot).

No extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller. Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my opinion.

We haven't flown BA for sometime and to be honest we have no desire to fly with BA again anytime soon. The plane was an Airbus 320 and was just like a bus. Uncomfortable hard very upright seats not even sure you can recline them. We sat in row 11 and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy although it seemed to be an issue in just 4 rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. We both came off the return flight with bad headaches. The food was simply awful thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option. The service was ok nothing to complain about very matter of fact and despite the previous comments the plane was clean etc. We flew the same route in October last year with a UK holiday airline and that was all round far more superior.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

D Corderoy,,,5,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Comfortable seats and plenty of space but the food was poor and the in-flight entertainment system was rubbish. The screens were small and the picture quality terrible. I liked that fact that the cabin crew were more mature people but the service was far from attentive. This is the first time I have flown with BA for over 15 years and I will try and avoid it in future.

Karen James,,,5,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Due to a health issue I chose to fly business class from Sydney to Singapore Singapore to Heathrow Heathrow to Mykonos and then returned BA15 6th October. I was seated in the same seat 16k both ways. My main problem was that by the time they got to me for each meal time whatever I had chosen off the menu they had run out of or there had been a mistake and they didn't have the meals that were on the menu. Often I would have to call out to them for a drink as they seemed to forget that there was another seat. In the morning because I am diabetic I had to go to the front and ask for something to eat which was hard as most people where sleeping and I didn't want to disturb anyone.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Boarding was quick and efficient in flight entertainment (IFE) was superb with plenty of very good choices latest releases. Probably the best I've seen in Economy class. Service was ok normal. B777 was great - I'm 6ft 4in so I asked for bulkhead seats. I ordered a special meal and it was ready for all four sections of my journey. LHR-DXB portion all good (B747). On the way back DXB-LHR was great (B777) - I took the 3.20pm outbound flight right after my business was completed (as opposed to taking those 1-2am flights that are offered by other air carriers). LHR-YYZ flew on the new Dreamliner 787. I was not too impressed with the seat configuration and space. To me the 777 was more comfortable.

Garry McMinigal,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Travelled back from Cape Town on 28th February 2015. Booked seats beforehand to make sure that we had front row seats only to get on the plane and discover contrary to what the webview had displayed we were bang smack in the middle of a row of seat! Complained to BA and told that the maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you're travelling on. What a total rip off! The seats were extremely cramped our inflight entertainment system keep failing. Once the food had been dished out and tidied away the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or drinks were offered until we were about two hours from landing! BA need to get their act together and invest in better aircraft's. Clapped out 747s - even first class looked shoddy!,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

A Crow,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew to Bangkok with Thai Airways who were lovely to fly with great choice of food and good leg room. We were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with BA. The leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic I couldn't see the TV screen as it was so close to my face as well as having to sit at an awkward position as I have long legs and couldn't put them out in front of me. So uncomfortable. The food was dire with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice After a fortnight of eating rice it would have been nice to have something different.

Actually had a very tasty steak out of EZE which was pink great! But full English breakfast is best avoided the continental choice was excellent. On schedule both ways and landed 30 minutes early both ways. Baggage arrived very promptly. For once there were no long queues at EZE. (Buenos Aires).

C Drake,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"LHR-Washington in Club World. My disappointment continues with BA on the A380 Club World seat. In theory being the flagship plane - it should have the flagship Business class seat. As a regular traveller with BA I know the ""Club"" product well and this seat is a lot more cramped than the older 777 product. What BA risk when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom WILL notice and take offence and fly with someone else. Its a bit like the BA First product this used to have caviar on the JFK route and silver plated cutlery and Krug champagne. Now they don't. I notice because I used to experience it.

Brad Basler,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew from SFO to Milan via Heathrow on 2/14 returned 2/21. Outbound was rescheduled due to changes requested by my company's business partner in Milan. This was the third reschedule and BA charged 433.40 533.90 and 275.00 successively on a basic $1822.00 economy flight. No other airline does this in my experience. Incredibly my travel agency could not reserve me a window seat ahead of time - unless I paid an extra $53.00 for each flight. I did so but was given an aisle seat on the outbound flight anyway. Both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. On the way out my antiquated in-flight display did not work. On the way back my headphone jack was broken. We left Heathrow 90 minutes late due to a computer glitch but for the next 12 hours the BA website indicated on time arrival so my wife waited two hours extra at SFO. Overall a very poor experience.

C Childs,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,My return flight from Cape Town to Heathrow BA0042 30/1/15 was a miserable experience. My entertainment system was not available for three hours despite being told that it could easily be re-set. (No one was available to do it). When it did become available it was lights-out time and my seat would not recline. It was not possible to focus on the screen with the reclined seat in front at such close quarters. Two stewardesses thought the seat belt was preventing the seat from reclining but when this was not the reason no one else came to investigate. No one seemed to care that I needed to stand for long periods to relieve my back. Being polite and patient did me no good. I have several questions. How often are the seats serviced? Why is the entertainment system so unreliable? How often are the seat belts checked because mine kept slipping? Customer Services want me to chose BA in the future but as they ignored addressing these issues when I wrote to them I have too many doubts.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

C Patterson,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,We flew with BA on 6th February to Goa - had three flights in all starting at Manchester. On our outbound journey we were upgraded to Premium Economy which was fantastic! Very comfortable food was much nicer. On our way back we were in economy. As a family of 4 we were split only by an aisle but it is much nicer to all sit together. Our youngest was awfully sick I think as a result of turbulence as well as sleep deprivation. Bless the steward who cleaned it up. However we were sat for 10 hours with the after effects! Nothing anyone could have done however. Staff always very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble. Would certainly fly again with them but this next time the prices have rocketed. Not as much room in the economy and when seats are reclined there's little room. The passenger in front kept putting her hands over the back of her head rest which then covered my TV screen - I had to keep moving them off. Just one bit of advice for the stewards - make sure during meal times you are vigilant in ensuring that passengers put their seats up!,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

The BA and Virgin flights to Gatwick were still on the Tarmac. All Virgin passengers were quickly met by a representative and sent through to the flight.

John Ince,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,On a recent flight from Johannesburg to London I was shocked to find such cramped seating conditions in the World Traveller economy class section. Having not been able to secure an aisle seat (which would have made minimal difference anyway) I was allocated a middle seat of 3. Like many other men (and some women) I am over 6 ft. with long legs so the acute discomfort I experienced was manifest from the start of the flight to the end about 10 hours. It was difficult to stretch my legs and at times I had to stand in my seat to alleviate leg cramp. It also caused me considerable back pain. I did offer to swap seats with a lady in the adjacent aisle seat but she was unwilling to do so that was her prerogative. So it became necessary to disturb her on a number of occasions to take a walk along the aisles in order to alleviate leg cramps. The cabin staff were co-operative in allowing me to use one of their seats in order to stretch my legs but had to return to mine during a period of turbulence. Reading very similar reviews it does make me wonder if British Airways will bother take any notice or continue to treat their passengers (customers) in this appalling fashion. About 10 years ago I experienced an appalling flight from Buenos Aires to London via British Airways (albeit for different reasons) and swore I would never use them again. But I felt I would give them one more chance. What a mistake. The world's favourite airline - don't make me laugh.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

I asked for a coffee because I was so cold but had to wait an hour and then had to ask again before I received it. The flight attendants on both flights did not look smart appeared to want to perform there duties as quickly as possible without any care for the passengers wishes so that they could stand and chat at back of flight and catch up with each other.

G Guy,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Sydney to Singapore return late Jan/early Feb 2015. The economy seats were relatively comfortable but could be a bit softer. The away leg (BA16) was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. The flight back had a much improved meal but the entertainment system had repeated issues and had to be restarted about 4 times. Another problem with the return leg (BA15) is that if you get on the plane in Singapore and not in London by the time online check-in is open for you there are almost no seats to choose from. I wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online check-in opened for me. Service on both flights was good. I was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. All the staff was nice and accommodating.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
Clive Drake,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"LHR-Zurich. The trip got off to a good start as the North lounge was not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test - which it is when it is busy. Had a nice early light lunch. The aircraft was a new A321. I like this plane. It was rammed end to end. The plane had the new Club Europe seats and it reminded me how well BA seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality - but isn't. Unless you are seated in row ""1"" - the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. As with the old C.E. seat - the centre seat between 3 seats - is a table. Quite why this is logical escapes me - because it seems to imply that if it suits BA they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. This was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable - wide C.E. seat. At the same time justify the higher pricing. Its no wonder BA have very few - if any - Travel Industry awards in the services they provide. So frustrating. I had another light lunch and a couple of Gin and Tonics which was nice. The FAs were great. Flight left a few minutes late but we whizzed over to Zurich in 80 minutes which was great. The World's favourite airline?

Seats weren't much different to other Business class seats we have experienced although I would suggest that couples don't choose window seats as they need to actually stand up and walk around to speak to their partner.

P Carter,,,9,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LGW-ACF-LGW (Club Europe) On both flights we had very good cabin staff infact the purser was the same on both flights and he was very efficient and very friendly as were both stewardesses. The food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were very happy. The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine. The leg rest has gone too so I had nothing to stop me moving forward and the space between rows felt a lot reduced.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Cabin is really smart. Arrived into LHR early which is a pleasant change despite the enforced 'stacking' that happens to flights landing at Heathrow. Return flight was great too due to the Captain and crew great service on a full flight however the A319 cabin was the old type and boy did it show!

Jack Whiteley,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,London Gatwick to Mauritius 27th December return 7th January. 777 Aircraft economy class. I never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. The seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. In the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. When the passenger in front put his seat back I couldn't use the tray and when I asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. Poor unfriendly service and absolute rubbish food. BA are miles behind the Far and Middle East airlines and still charging more.

BA is far behind a lot of airlines in business class. The seat is small if you are over 6 feet tall. Staff ok. They don't go out of their way. It seems that they are just doing their job. You don't see them between meals. They need to step up their game. I don't think BA is a 4 star airline.

S Adlam,,,10,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,BA179 Jan 6 2015 LHR-JFK. First. T5 is great for the first class experience with check in security and straight into the Concorde room. The lounge and spa facilities are a great refuge while flying especially the dining room. The 777 has more room in the cabin than the 747 flight to London which I appreciated especially when it came to my bed. Seat 2A is private and roomy. It was a full flight so service was efficient and friendly if not a little rushed. Overall the service was at the great BA standard. What was lacking was the meal was lacking the freshness and taste which was disappointing. There was major (1hr) delay in planing at JFK which was not BA's fault but really made this flight much longer than it should had been.

R Rodway,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Being an ex pat I decided to fly the flag from Seattle back to England in November 2014 to celebrate my 60th birthday. I was accompanied by my wife a son and daughter with their spouse's and our 2 year old grandson. Between us all we spent a considerable amount of money to fly economy class. After a short time into the flight we soon discovered the economy seats on the 777 to be extremely small uncomfortably close to the seats in front of us with almost no legroom and armrest that only fold up halfway! I wonder what genius came up with that one. Aside from serving us ""steerage"" passengers that stuff they called food and a drink we never saw the cabin crew in both directions. They wouldn't even come around to collect the trash so we sat amidst it. They didn't even check to see if my grandson needed anything.

Mike Rickett,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I flew to Toronto from Manchester via T5 Heathrow on Dec 17 returning on Jan 5. I have no complaints about the inflight experience which was generally very good although I am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money. What I found completely annoying was the lack of air-bridges both on departure and arrival at T5 Heathrow. We were herded on to buses like cattle closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep steps into the aircraft no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free. Are there not enough gates with air bridges at T5? Why is this necessary. I will be flying to Toronto again in September but I am not sure it will be with BA if this situation persists.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Coffee rubbish asked for more water and never got any? The inflight entertainment was also poor and a film was stopped after 30 minutes to reboot the system for other passengers. The male stewards were fine and happy but one of the female stewardesses was miserable and we felt we were putting her out asking for a drink which never arrived anyway?

A Singh,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Los Angeles - Heathrow - Los Angeles over the holidays. Club world is a perfectly fine business product. Staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. Food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. Portion sizes not huge but I don't need the calories anyway. Plenty of drinks offered. An unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if I was ok and if I would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. In terms of product this is not a million miles away from United business (both even have backwards-facing seats). However the BA cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. United's intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. Just like with the 747 the upstairs on the A380 has side storage which is useful. The upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). But downstairs is light and roomy. On return on Dec 29 I was delayed at the gate at Heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated. These company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in Club and behaved appallingly for 11 hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the A380 from every crew member that passed. They acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. Upshot? As long as BA doesn't stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you you'll enjoy club world on the A380.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

N Bhettay,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Really like the new business class cabins on the BA A380 (LHR-JNB) - the dimmed lighting is so civilized and much more conducive to long haul travel and getting some sleep. Why do we need to have those ridiculous lights in cabins on so bright? Chairs seem to be slimmer though and the last row practically is the first row of premium economy where all the new babies inevitably travel. Not great for business class sleeping and poor design there. Great service and food and beverages continue to be high quality great menus also good entertainment selection.

Outbound flight delayed (which seems to happen on a regular basis for this flight) which meant a missed connection in BKK. Flight ok but the catering was ridiculous on a 11 hr sector only 2 choices which meant they ran out of chicken after about 5 rows and everyone else had to make do with the vegetarian option. Flight back was on time still only 2 choices of meals but the crew were excellent very friendly and approachable. The IFE was very limited compared to the Middle Eastern carriers and BA really do need to up their game if they're to compete with Emirates Etihad and Qatar on these routes. It's also much easier to fly with those airlines if you are from any part of the UK other than London and the Southeast of England as BA only do long haul from LHR and LGW.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

The quality of the planes on this route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect and this trip was no exception.

Maybe it was because of the hideous centre console (that houses he folding table) was smaller - rather than take up half the space. To start we had a small ""appetizer"" (an Amuse Bouche) which was absolutely hideous. A sort of grilled cheese with burnt bits on it and some sort of couscous. It was foul and we left the lot. Both had a langoustine starter which was ok. The mushrooms with it was wet and horrible texture to the mouth. The soup we both had was nice. My cod dish was very good. My wife said the steak two ways was ok. The braised part she did not eat. Wines all ok. Service from the FAs was fine. In terms of overall quality BA really fail consistently to deliver. As a matter of curiosity I sourced the on way price the day before we left; £5543 - one way. Its an insane price and if I paid that I would be furious as to the product I experienced. Travelling in 1st is only worth it on ""sale"" offers or Avios. We are travelling back in Club as in my experienced the slightly shorter flight home in First is not worth the money or the Avios. So disappointing. BA really are clueless when it comes to understanding ""quality"".",Unknown,First Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
Tony Banwait,,,6,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,SFO-LHR-SFO in Premium Economy in December 2014. Outbound flight - an older 747-400 showing signs of age. Crew not too friendly and were not seen after dinner service. Only one drink offered. Quite impressed with dinner filet of beef which I believe was from Club menu. Breakfast sadly was a cold croissant and jam. Return flight much better with attentive crew. Double dose of drink was a nice start. Again served a filet of beef from Club menu which was very good. Older 747-400s need retiring very soon. Premium economy seats are ok but get cramped after a few hours of sitting.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

We were served a croissant and cereal bar plus coffee and a yoghurt at about 1000hrs. No further trolley service at all during this four and a half hour flight. On the return leg leaving Tenerife at 1415hrs we were served a wrap and a cheese roll with either drink from the bar or hot drink. The drinks were served after the meal. No further trolley service. The seating configuration was tight to say the least and I am 5'8. This felt like a budget airline flight.

R Simon,,,9,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,VIE-LHR on Nov 29 on an Airbus 320 in Economy - straightforward evening point to point flight with a mixed fleet crew. Flight departed on time and landed ahead of time in Heathrow which is a rare thing these days. No luggage to check and web check-in was working fine. Plane featured the new slim seats which are a step back in both comfort and legroom. Mixed fleet FA's were pleasant however the service was not particularly well organized. It took them quite some time for the service to start and it took more than 30 minutes to get a drink after the sandwich has been served. On the other hand the bacon sandwich was actually good and full bar service was offered. Other than the “required service” of sandwich drink and duty free the crew was pretty much in hiding mode. Service not quite up to usual BA standards. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which this time was quite busy but not overcrowded. Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great. Still believe that BA offers one of the best economy products on the European market and flying them is in general a pleasant experience.

I Lancaster,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LHR to IST in economy. Excellent! I thought it was a new A320 but FA told me it was not new it was refurbished. Well done BA on a good re-design: new lighting seats clever seat-back storage etc. I believe they've reduced the economy seat pitch but the design is such that you don't notice. Dinner was served on this evening flight - a very tasty Chicken curry with cheese/crackers and chocolate mousse desert. A very decent meal for a 4-hour flight in economy. FAs were courteous and efficient. The only negative was security at LHR T5 where there was a long delay because of installation of new machines and security alert that morning.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Robert Davidson,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,BGI-LGW Premium Economy August 2014. Silver Tier Status. Older plane with older version of BA PE seat. Adequate leg room though. Cabin crew barely visible for the 8 hour flight and quite short tempered when they served dinner and breakfast. On BA website PE meals advertised as being a choice of two dishes off the Business menu. We were definitely served an Economy meal for dinner which was fairly average. Breakfast before we landed in LGW consisted of a hard cold croissant with jam and fresh orange with tea/coffee. At the end of an 8 hour flight this was really disappointing and I would have been disappointed with this in Economy never mind PE. When I asked a flight attendant about this I was treated abysmally. Overall it is not worth paying extra for PE taking into account the poor standard of meals but especially the lack of courtesy and basic manners shown by cabin crew.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

J Dob,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,British Airways for some reason was incapable of seating me next to my husband during our recent 8 hour flight. We made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. This was our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. It is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other. When we tried to change our seats to be together all representatives said being separated was typical. Which is strange because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason. While it's always fun to meet new strangers we will not be flying with British Airways again.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Worcester David,,,6,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LCA-LHR in Club Europe. Decided to check a bag in to see how T5 baggage arrivals performed. Pleasant check-in experience. Security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottles and liquids that was a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of us queuing behind them. The Cyprus airways lounge whilst much better than its predecessor is still third rate with a poor selection of food and wine and on this occasion overcrowded. Wandered to the gate in good time for boarding to be confronted by a flotilla of wheelchair-bound passengers all of whom get ultra priority boarding. So boarding took longer despite the fact that whilst Business class was almost full economy wasn't. On-board service was ok. Hot towels no menus drinks and a 3 course meal salad main dessert or cheese but somehow the service was not as impressive as my outbound. Queue longer to get through the e-passport channel than the regular immigration route but at least arriving in the baggage hall our bag was on the carousel.

,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,HKG-LHR-Bergen: Stockholm-LHR-HKG - A380 on long haul/A319 for short haul. I always like the forward Club cabin on BA's A380 Upper Deck despite the 7-across seating making it seem a bit cramped. Short delay to outward sector due to technical problems some of which had not been ironed out on take off. The screen dividers IFE and then the seat reclines had problems and required resetting. It was an hour before these were sorted out. My main concern on long-haul is merely sleep. The Qantas lounge in HKG is excellent and so no need to have dinner in flight. Also skipped breakfast as there is an excellent one in the Arrivals lounge. With BA having cancelled the morning flight to Bergen about 5 months after I booked my ticket I was stuck with a lengthy 12-hour connection. En route to Bergen the service for just 10 Club passengers was poor - way below expectations. With only 12 meals boarded of which 6 were a fish curry that no-one wanted (curry on a Norway flight?) 4 of us were stuck with sandwiches from the back. No tea or coffee service unless specifically requested. Return to LHR from Stockholm was a huge improvement. Friendly service quick drinks service and tasty lunch. Slept most of the way back to HKG again deciding not to eat or watch any IFE. In that respect the flight was excellent.,Business,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

The crew food and inflight entertainment were good. We travelled economy and paid an extra £140 to reserve 2 seats on the upper deck. We found the seats uncomfortable and when the person in front reclined their seat you were trapped. Leg room was restricted by the video box.

D Nolan,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Travelled to and from India recently in Club World. Outbound to Hyderabad and return from Mumbai. Outbound we had the 787 which is a nice plane to travel on when in Club World. It was definitely helped by the fact that the cabin was only 40% full. I was surprised that they had only loaded one of the cold options as a main meal. Not what you would expect from a full service airline. On the return from Mumbai flew on a 777 which is showing its age. The crew were very distant and far from warm. The hot dish for breakfast (a frittata) was tasteless and given that this was the main meal for the flight (due to time of departure) was disappointing. I agree with previous reports that the more experienced crew are more distant and lacking in customer service when compared with the newer crew. Based on my flying experience over the past few years I would prefer to fly with the mixed fleet crew. They are definitely more approachable. Overall flights were fine and on time. The above demonstrates failures in service levels which once again confirms that all of the 'enhancements' being introduced by BA are going in one direction the wrong one!,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Club class cabins seem fairly spacious - (I was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. Excellent bathrooms - really spacious. One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 Negatives - The food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible. Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better.

Paul Wylie,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Round-the-Worldticket. JFK-LHR-TXL on 28/29 July 2014. TXL-LHR-MAN on 2 August 2014. All flights on time. Great service from cabin crews. Meals and drinks absolutely fine - no complaints at all. Lovely lounge at TXL small but more than made up for by the local staff in the lounge. Check in at TXL was a bit chaotic as there is hardly any space for waiting passengers. NCE-LHR on 30 August 2014. Flight left late missed landing slot and had to circle resulting in a missed connection at LHR to DXB. LHR-DXB on 31 August 2014. BA ground service was exemplary. Re- booked us on next day's flight. We had to stay overnight near LHR - refunded by BA. Baggage did not reach us in DXB until day of departure (not BA's fault) but BA refunded costs of essential replacement clothing. Flight was great ditto service from cabin crew. One member of ground crew at boarding was a bit 'short' with us but he had been given a rough time by a couple of recalcitrant Y passengers trying to board with F and J passengers. Overall very satisfied with BA.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

T Chamberlain,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,London Gatwick to Tampa and return BA2167 and 2166. Outbound flight departure was delayed for over an hour due to 'technical problems'. 90 minutes late arriving. In flight service to economy poor very few drinks people having to go to the galley to get water or juice. Special meal on return awful and inedible. We ordered the same but got a different dish. Didn't eat it. Return flight delayed over an hour due to sick passenger which necessitated return to stand and passenger/ bag offload. Entertainment system unreliable screen cutting out. Check in staff in Tampa told us we had no seats despite having printed boarding passes! Turned out her computer was on the wrong day!

Ed Warren,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew LGW - MCO 26th October. Was a bit worried about BA after a lot of mixed reviews. Found the whole experience great. We were travelling with a 4 month old and the crew were faultless. So helpful and caring as they could tell we were nervous about disturbing other club world passengers. Food good - fresh and tasty. Entertainment not really used due to entertaining daughter! Left and arrived on time - BA lounge Gatwick fine but thought was a bit small. Bought 2 return flights and baby seat for under £3k in BA sale so good on cost. Well done BA and thank you.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

L Channon,,,6,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Went to BKK via Heathrow on 26th October. Was all excited to be flying back to Thailand. I know direct flights are better but longer but thought flying with the UK flag carrier I was going to get a good flight. Well to be honest I was disappointed - I was at least expecting to be able to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business class. Most other airlines have this facility in economy. No menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. Drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. Inflight entertainment was poor at best and was bored witless with films I have seen before or had no interest in. Even the documentaries were all BBC which were ok. Music was equally lacklustre and limited. Only saving grace was the seat I was in and that was the only positive aspect despite the fact there was a baby crying most of the time. Sorry BA. I was expecting a good experience but felt let down and disappointed.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Jamie Fenton,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Terrible experience flying back from Munich. Flight delayed by several hours which meant arriving back into Heathrow T5 at gone midnight after most of the public transport links had ceased running. Nobody at BA available to help (despite them knowing the flight was several hours late arriving) which resulted in having to sleep at the airport floor overnight. Appalled that BA would do this - it was an unpleasant experience but I coped but what about elderly travellers? To make matters worse there was nobody available as a BA representative at Munich airport during the delay until I complained.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Rips in seats badly worn seat pockets very noisy aircraft particularly on landing not the most comfortable seats although leg room is good. Would have preferred a choice of food rather than just a wrap as this is meant to be a premium airline. Not a bad airline for short-haul really but I have had much better experiences this year with Norwegian and EasyJet both of which I will now choose over BA when possible until they heavily invest into their short-haul fleet.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

K Nicol,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LAX to LHR - 25 Oct 2014. I agree with other reviewers that Business Class on the A380 is too crowded. I am a frequent business traveller to LAX and if I had the choice I would rather be on the upper deck of the 747. The seats and small storage drawer (if you are on the aisle) feel cheap. Service levels seem to be dropping in terms of drinks before dinner (1 instead of 2) and no attention to top up during the meal. My main course of fish was inedible due to being overcooked. The staff seem grumpy about the smaller galley size (can't blame them). We flew First on the outbound to LAX which of course was better although the cabin feels quite sterile.

Garreth Elston,,,9,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew BA from Toronto to New Delhi via London in Premium Economy class in August. First leg was on a 787 plane was nice but definitely does not have nearly enough toilets on board. Premium Economy passengers have quite a walk to the nearest lavatory (bad bad design). On board service was very good staff were great food was good. Next leg from London to New Delhi was on a 777 much better in my opinion that the Dreamliner primarily as it has better toilet facilities. Again staff and service were top notch. Our return trip in October was made with our newborn baby. If anything the service was even better than on our first leg. Thankfully we had a 777 on both legs and not the Dreamliner. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help. Again the food and beverage service was very good. The seat reclining buttons were a bit stiff but other than that the seats were OK not excellent but definitely comfortable enough. Considering that I hadn't flown BA for over ten years before these flights (due to bad service) I was really pleasantly surprised by the improved level of service provided by the airline. Yes being in Premium Economy helped but I was very satisfied comparing it to Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy which I have regularly used. Well done BA you made a trip that we were dreading actually quite a pleasant experience and I'm likely to fly BA again now.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
J Miller,,,10,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Round-trip IAD-LHR in early October and it was one of the best trips I've taken. The seat may be the same size as on US carriers but it felt a lot larger. I was stunned to be served a free cocktail and a free bottle of wine with dinner which was a totally edible chicken casserole in one direction and a surprisingly good chicken curry in the other direction. I was also pleased to get a blanket and headphones (though I had my own). US carriers don't give squat to economy passengers and I was delighted. Service was the quickest most efficient I've ever seen on an airplane. Loved the entertainment system. Even the boarding process was seriously well organized with separate lines and doors for each section of the plane. This was about as painless as it could possibly have been. I will never fly an American carrier to Europe again. I also got a good deal at a little over $700 as fall is a down season.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
A Cowdrey,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Arrived at Gatwick to find out that our pre-paid for assigned seats could not be honoured due to an aircraft change. Instead of three rows of seats A and B we were now slung across a single row with 4 middle seats and an aisle/window seat despite having requested and paid for the seat reservations 11 months ago. To make matters worse Prem Economy passengers had been bumped up to Club World and were enjoying A/B seats - total joke. Food was OK crew were friendly enough but I will never travel BA again due to the absolute neglect or consideration for their premium customers. Goodbye BA Executive Club and good riddance BA.

It was bad enough sitting in the seat but when the person in front of me lowered his seat it became impossible. His seat was right on my legs that shows how little room there is on these planes.

Crew very good the seat PTV and food not the best on this flight. I've used BA a lot over the past 2 years and find them pretty consistent although I've also noticed that service along with seats PTV of course is much nicer on the newer A380s or the 777-300s so it's worth choosing your aircraft.

It was on the new Dreamliner with very tight seats the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs! Service almost non-existent even on a 9 hour trip! Beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didn't even ask us whether we would like anything.

The air steward wasn't friendly at all and was borderline aggressive when asking passengers to take a seat when the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on. The inflight entertainment needs updating.

E Eriksson,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,OSL-LHR in Business. BA has over the last few years put less priority on Oslo and SAS today has a better offering. BA is the only flag carrier in Oslo that does not offer fast track security. The Menzies ground staff are doing their best but does not have any authority to help when things go wrong. Particularly the evening flights are very often delayed due to late incoming aircraft from LHR and I have several times been an hour or more delayed and lost intercontinental flights as a result. The de-icing procedure is also much slower than on SAS. The lounge in Oslo is nice but not magnificent. BA has better service in business class than SAS with better food and free middle seat. You do however pay much more than for SAS Plus. The crew was friendly and did their best on my last flight but seemed badly trained forgot to serve bread with the meal and spent a lot of time chatting in the galley. One sometimes miss the old well trained BA staff.

Lounge at Gatwick was good and staff very attentive no lounge at Catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the BA approved cafe next to the non Schengen passport control. Flights both ways were good and we liked the Pilot pointing out Lake Geneva and telling us about our route so nicely. The return flight back to LGW the Captain was hard to hear and wasn't so interesting. That aside on both journeys we felt well looked after with charming FAs. The food was also good too and we landed on time. Baggage came very quickly at LGW but at Catania airport it was a bit of a carnival!

Asked for another glass of wine twice with my main the stewardess forgot and denied that I had even asked for one. Food going out was pretty good but coming home just awful.

James williams,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I flew one way MCO-LGW 6th October the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations British Airways has lost a customer for life. I requested assistance due to illness which I couldn't have at Orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait? When boarding they wouldn't let me board without checking with three people just because I was young and didn't appear to need assistance. After this I could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldn't even ask if I was ok. The drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. The meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. The 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. Why do they need to be chilled? Room temp would make them a bit better. The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. The IFE screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both Virgin and Thomson on this route. When I got to Gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance - if you don't look old then you shouldn't need assistance.

P Oliver,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"LGW to CMB via MLE and return Sept/Oct 2014. As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary ""A Very British Airline"" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.",Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

D Rahmatallah,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,777-200 4-class refitted with the new World Traveller and WT Plus cabins. LHR-DEL-LHR. Very disappointed. On the outbound flight the food choice was gone before they reached the 4th row of the economy cabin meaning that myself and the rest of the cabin had to have the second choice meal - second choice for good reason. It was a truly unpleasant tray of food. The real issue is the introduction of possibly the largest entertainment equipment box in the floor space I have ever seen. It literally takes up half of the floor and prevents you from stretching both legs out. I don't know if this is exclusive to the refitted B777's but it is certainly a side effect of the new IFE and isn't there on the the older cabins. The box seems to be under every window seat on both sides of the cabin. I really don't understand what the cabin designers were thinking allowing this box to take up so much of the space that is already so precious. They could have at least rounded off the corners.

Philip Clacher,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Don't even think about flying on this airline. Booked paid for and confirmed last February for a premium economy flight Singapore to Sydney for last Saturday. When I checked in at Changi the check-in staff member told me the incoming flight from London was overbooked and I was downgraded to economy (against my wishes obviously). I would never have booked BA but for the premium economy offering so huge disappointment. GB75 compensation is simply not good enough. Add to that the economy meal was inedible (what did they do to the seafood curry). Never again.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

G Gibb,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"LGW to SZG. Absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. Luckily we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in the North of England as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"". BA need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice.

Bob Motto,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,VIE to LHR - Seats were of the new configuration only 30 inches both in Club and Economy. The seats are very uncomfortable and there is very little room to relax or work if the passenger in front reclines their seat. The new cabin looks very small with the new seats and I would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with BA now. The service was not to a good service and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on they were more concerned in their own conversations. I hasten to add that this is the new cabin crew with the thunderbird hats who are far inferior to the well paid counterparts. BA short hall can now be classified as a Low Cost Carrier now they have lost all sense of customer service & customer needs.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
Burke Tom,,,6,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew the new 787 Business Class from PHI to LHR. The aircraft was impressive. It was quiet and comfortable. The lower altitude cabin and the higher humidity were not noticeable in flight but the lack of jetlag was noticeable. Service was very good. The business cabin was 2/3 empty. The cabin crew were very attentive. The negatives was the seating and entertainment system. With the large windows the rear facing seats were a poor design. The feeling of closeness was uncomfortable. I guess the extra seat they squeeze in makes it all worth while to the airline. The amount of choices in all the video selection and the content left a lot to be desired. Return was in a 777. The seating and entertainment were the same This and the A380 use to be my favorite airplane. However the 787 has become favorite airplane now.

J Wer,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Traveled to Rome with British Airways. On the way there everything went fine. A day before our departure we were told that the flight was overbooked and asked politely to change to a different flight. We were told that they would pay for the taxi (the flight was earlier and no public transport was available.) as well as for the breakfast that we were missing at our hotel. We agreed to change because we sympathized with BA representative who had a difficult job of asking people to move to a different flight and because we wanted to support British Airways. Big mistake. Apparently everything we were told by their representative was a lie and no refund for the taxi fare was given to us. So much for doing BA a favor they are not a reputable company they once were.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

The next morning we wake to find our flight now leaves at the break of the next day at half 12 in the evening! We booked our flight to leave Saturday so we would arrive home on Sunday and be able to go back to work for the Monday. But thanks to the reliability of British Airways not only had we paid for two - now immensely - overpriced flights we will be loosing money from not being able to attend our jobs! Absolutely disgusting show from BA I honestly wouldn't even chance a brief flight with them for fear of having to cancel numerous plans due to the ineptitude of a shoddily run business!

B Motto,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew VIE to LHR Club Europe fantastic crew looking after the Club Europe cabin the only let down is the new revamped Club Europe Cabin. I really do not believe what BA is saying that this is what their European Passengers want! The seat pitch has now been reduced from 34 inches to 30 inches which used to be the Charter Airlines seat pitch years ago. If the passenger in front reclines their seat it is impossible to work on your laptop as there is no room. I really am not able to justify paying the Club Europe Fare for an economy class seat which is the most uncomfortable seat I have ever say in. A number of passengers were not impressed with the new cabin and all felt badly let down by BA. British Airways used to be a class above the rest now they are just an average low cost carrier but still charge the high fares BA really need to think seriously about the Club Europe layout they have added more seats so it is all about money & not about what their passengers really want.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Boy was I wrong - we were squeezed in so tightly it was almost impossible to get out without injuring the poor person in the aisle seat and when the person in front reclined her seat my daughter could hardly move - we had to ask a flight attendant to make the person put their seat upright so that we could eat our meals. Even worse - I actually paid extra to choose our seats in advance thinking that a window and centre seat wouldn't be so bad.

J Epsom,,,5,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Booked a British Airways holiday so that's flight and hotel from London City Airport to Florence Peretola Airport. Either it came up from the BA Rep. or my husband asked about an upgrade to Business Class and was told that would be an extra £300 for the return trip. As it was for a significant birthday he thought why not. Reasons why no-one should bother with this upgrade for this particular flight. 1) No separate BA lounge at either London City or Peretola Airports. 2) Faster boarding? Entirely pointless when you all have to get onto a bus to take you to the aeroplane at Florence. 3) Bigger seats and more leg room? They are small planes so the same throughout. 4) Luggage off first? No point when it takes over an hour to get through customs at Florence. 5) Better meal? Yes choice of meat or fish. Very nice but worth £75 each? The BA Rep should have told us about the lack of facilities and suggest a hotel upgrade instead. It was a perfectly pleasant flight the holiday was great but we paid an extra £300 for no reason whatsoever.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Les Bell,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"London to Budapest on Club World-now I don't even mention the fact that my luggage hasn't arrived but the price for club world is a huge rip off! You can sit in the new ""slimline"" type of seat-which is thinner than the previous ones and some genius obviously thought that if they put in thinner seats why not squeeze in another 2 extra rows which means that the leg space is less than half as it was in the old days - so exactly like in economy class. So you pay 300 dollars more for 3 stale finger sandwich and a scone - what a bargain! Shame on you BA for the lousy service.

Michael Orr,,,9,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew from London to Doha on a newly refurbished 777. Smooth ride through airport and pleasant staff on hand to help. Boarding was on time but there was a slight delay which put us back by half an hour and delayed take off. Captain was good at keeping us informed. Cabin Crew friendly enough but seemed tired in their service and no smile. Food was average and not anything to write home about. I felt I had to eat quickly as the flight attendant was waiting for me to finish my last bite with a stern look! Inflight entertainment was excellent and kept me entertained throughout the six hours you have got an array of movies TV games and Music to choose from. Seats were really comfy and I got a good kip.

Peter Ford,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,ATL to LHR: Boeing 777 (Economy). I've just returned from a family holiday in the USA and flew BA Economy. The flight was slightly delayed but most of this delay was made up during the journey. Staff were pleasant and the IFE was fine. However the food was terrible. Main meal was a choice of Chicken Curry and Rice or a Veggie Pasta. Breakfast before landing was a cold box consisting of a Croissant bag of Cranberries and a Granola Bar. What has happened to the 2 meat choices? (Veggies choose veggie option in advance) and a cooked breakfast? BA have a British flag on the tail but do not serve any British food. I'm a Silver Executive Club member and food on BA has been deteriorating over the last couple of years.

I Raymond,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew LHR to Muscat return in Club World on a 777-200 (G-ZZZA). Loyal BA customers and have flown Club World many times. BA long haul fleet starting to show it's age cabins looking a bit old and some of the equipment not working as it should. On our flight my TV would not stay in position and kept falling back into it's default position (and therefore not viewable). Had to stuff some coffer cup protectors under the pivot arm to keep it in place. This is not the type of quality you expect when you are paying several thousand for your flights. Food and service very good as usual. BA need to make sure that they inspect and make sure that everything works in the Clud cabin every trip! When you paying the sort of money a club or first ticket costs you expect everything to be perfect. Agee with other comments about Club World layout it is starting to annoy me climbing over someone's legs to get out to use the toilet! Generally still think BA is a good quality product but haven't tried Emirates Qatar etc. yet!,Unknown,First Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Paul Ingram,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic. I know BA have monopoly on the direct route from Gatwick to Male but I will be going via Dubai on Emirates in future.",Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

B gate lounge quiet nice refreshments-I don't think the children's games consoles have worked in the entire time T5 has been open. Short walk to boarding full plane left slightly early landed well ahead of schedule. Crew excellent worked hard throughout. Decent food as well (again). Entertainment out on new system good older system back not as good and screen not in best order.

Tibble Simon,,,9,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,BA2590 20 Aug LGW TO BRI. We checked in online so only had to drop baggage and clear security. Wrong what a chaotic system BA were running. Everyone who checked in online had to wait in a very long line to simply have their bags tagged and sent on their way by a member of BA staff. If this is the case then please get all the counters working and clear the queue quickly. Pity the poor people who squeezed their way to the self check in and bag tagged their bags only to be told to join the same line. I can not understand how the system is supposed to be more efficient. We then had the situation of BA staff dragging people out of the line as they were going to miss their flight. Even the very nice BA staff member who did our bag tags could not explain what went wrong. Flight was delayed on boarding due to flight coming in late. No issue with boarding or the staff on board all very helpful. We have a drink and wrap which was very good. Captain kept us informed of the delay and we landed 30 mins late and he did apologise again for late arrival.

M Green,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I flew from London to Sydney Club World / Business Class. Having done similar OZ flights recently with Qatar Airlines the experience was like comparing the Premium to Third Division football clubs. Everything about BA was shoddy shabby and second rate - so sad. Numerous examples from the Business Lounge the lay out of the cabin the comfort of the seats privacy food service - all second rate. And for about £2 K extra flight cost. Why? I would seriously consider flying to Sydney via Perth next time - longer but an experience where you arrive feeling caressed not bundled along. Really pains me to say this - a very poor way to present a country's airline.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
A Razak,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,BA12 15th August 2014. In my mind that when I bought the BA tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. It turned out to be totally wrong. I used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with BA from Changi Airport to Heathrow was the worst in so many ways. Not worth money spent at all! Firstly the seat space was really small (I cant imagine those who are bigger than I am because I am a medium size person). Secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. They only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. Thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class (no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls). Lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. The movies selection must have been 2 years old. Flimsy earphones and outdated screens. All in all an unhappy customer.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
Alan Thompson,,,7,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Bari to Gatwick. This flight seems to be late on a regular basis. Three times an hour late and once two hours late this summer of the four times I was involved. Seems the summer schedule is very optimistic Check-in at Bari is hopeless always queues and 'bag drop' seems to be used by travellers with ticketing problems. Boarding is poor regularly left to wait in a hot air bridge between the gate and the plane. None of this done by BA staff but they are doing BA's reputation no good seemingly using the level of service expected with the low cost carriers that also go to London. Onboard though is always good despite the age of the planes. Fair choice of drinks and a good sandwich nice crew. My flight ended with a 50 minute wait for luggage.

Donnelly Chris,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I flew from Singapore to Heathrow on a B747 which is certainly an ageing aircraft that showed its age. I think this is one of BA's main let-downs. The inflight entertainment was slightly disappointing. There wasn't a single movie that I fancied but then I suppose everyone has different tastes. I did listen to some music though. The service on board was generally good at least on the side of the aircraft I was on. The stewardess who served was very kind and attentive. The food was good although I got a sense that something was missing from the meal overall. It wasn't highly appealing. I also find the seats comfortable they are softer than those on Singapore Airlines. I slept very well and I'm not usually one to sleep particularly well on flights. BA can certainly improve in some aspects but overall I have found them a pleasure to travel with.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. Compared to many airlines the BA premium service is poor and I don't know how they keep a 4 star rating. The cabin crew were excellent though I will concede. Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess. The 787 was good and BA have improved their IFE system but screens are small and have to be stowed for take off and landing unlike those in economy and premium.

Cabin was in a good shape seat pitch 34 inch and the width 17 inch. Lounge in DUS (Airport owned Lounge) is quite nice but nothing special Lounge of BA in LHR T5 is very good with a lot of space even it was very busy at this time but anyway we know it from other times when it was quite empty. No check-in because of hand luggage only. BA 937 was delayed for about 1 hour due to foggy weather in London so the very nice staff start to serve Drinks to reduce the waiting time on ground. Brunch served after takeoff a choice between a cold platter with assorted cheese and meat and bread/rolls or a warm cheese and ham croissant and salad. Drinks including Champagne were served twice. More enough for that relatively short flight. Check-in for BA 932 (bought liquids) in T5 was very quick also friendly staff. BA Lounge as I wrote was busy but worth it to reduce waiting time. Very nice flight attendants drinks served 3 times light Dinner with mixed salad.

Cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what. No inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie. However we departed on time and arrived 15 min before schedule and the price was the cheapest ever for a Business Class seat.

T Kohn,,,5,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,12/2013. LHR-LAX. A380. Aircraft was clean. Seats were comfortable but the leg space was restricted by the IFE- computer which has been installed underneath the seat in front. Amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphones and toothbrush. There were no eye shades and ear plugs. Food both ways the same selection: Tikka Masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant. FA's lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation. There was on both flights repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hours not present in the cabin. IFE-system is good with a big selection of movies documentaries etc. Due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preferences. This experience with British Airways is not compatible to other flag carriers due to the lack in service and the restricted seating.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Only drawback are the very few drink rounds that were made during this 11 hour flight. We were seated on the upper deck on row 74.

The configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function. The TV screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat. The service was excellent from two male crew members and the food and wine selection was of a high standard.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
E McKerrell,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Flew on a 777-200 from London Heathrow to San Diego worst flight I have taken on British Airways. Being a rather tall person 6'7"" and travelling in economy the person in front of me could not recline his seat due to my legs blocking his recline he complained to the cabin personnel that he could not recline and I was asked to remove my knees so he could recline stating to cabin crew that I would not have a comfortable journey they did not seem to care. When the food was served I could not even put my tray table down so the cabin crew would not serve me a meal stating that the tray must be in the down position to eat a meal. So to tell you the truth I spent the best part of 7 hours of a 11 hour flight in the toilet at least in there I could stretch out my legs. Wrote a letter to British Airways to inform them of my flight haven't heard anything back from them. Just shows you they really care about their passengers.",Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

S Tibble,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,10th July BA117 LHR-JFK. Well I have not flown with BA for a number of years as they are not my favourite airline from past experience. We were travelling with hand luggage so should be easy. Decided to not pre purchase seats but go for online check in and seat selection. All very easy and got good seats on 777-300 should have been 747 but obviously had an aircraft change. So we arrive at airport and go to security and scan our boarding cards get rejected you need to get your passport and visa validated from the BA desk before you can proceed. Would be good if this was shown on boarding pass. Boarding very good onto a new plane good seats good entertainment staff seemed interested and engaging. All the crew seemed very good.

Transferred through T5 quick and easy. Must say that Heathrow gets better and better for every time you visit! The long haul flight on BA's A380 was excellent. I was sat on the upper deck which is a huge privilege since the seats are 2-4-2 also I was sat in a window seat which made it all even better since they've installed lockers next to the seats where you can put your stuff. The staff was excellent (and also very good looking) and the food was better than I could've imagined for an economy route. The whole experience was overall better than I'd thought for a 500$ ticket and so far the best I've gone with when it comes to flights over the Atlantic.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

G Thompson,,,9,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Once on plane saw a number of economy passengers throw their hand luggage up in the open lockers above the Club Europe passengers which we feel should be policed as the late arrivals of the Club Europe passengers had no room to put their hand luggage. Service and meals were average but really not worth the extra money especially once we got to Rome when all the Club Europe Passengers luggage was last off we waited close to 30 minutes.

Yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the Asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with BA is unbeatable. And for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is what matters the most. Contrary to general recommendations when I travel with a companion I prefer the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by using the screen you can have your own little intimate cabin. And if the flight is not full is so much better than the claustrophobic upper deck.

Veggie meal ordered was given to someone else by mistake so I had to have fish. Video screen is tiny on these planes - not that it mattered as the system wasn't working properly so I couldn't watch any films. Pretty poor on a 9.5 hour flight.

However the on-board service continues to be of a high standard and the Airbus 321 clean and tidy with very helpful cabin crew.

Was really looking forward to flying in the new A380 but for some reason the plane was swapped on the day for a B777. Flight left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early into HK. On boarding I agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. Having ordered a vegetarian meal I let one of the cabin crew know that I'd swapped seats. When the meal was served I got told off very rudely by one of the cabin crew for moving seats without telling them - even though I had. Before I could explain my meal was dumped in my lap and he flounced off. Food was ok. Cabin crew smiles were forced. Serve the meal turn out the lights and disappear for 9 hours seemed to be the order of the day.

Bob Motto,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LHR to VIE BA 704 23 June 2014. The meal service in Euro Traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the New Mixed Fleet Crew The food offering was inedible a choice of Flat Bread with Chicken Tikka or a Salad. Do British Airways not understand that not everyone likes Curry or spicy food. At least do an offering of Meat or Cheese Sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. As for the cabin crew this new Mixed Fleet with their Thunderbird Hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. At least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. This crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. I would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the Duty Free. I fly British Airways every week and this is the worst crew I have known. I think the Mixed Fleet Crew are appalling in their customer service standards they can certainly learn a lot from their more experiences colleagues who are on the old contracts so come on BA start to bring back the high standards again the new Mixed Fleet Crew are letting you down very badly.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

I always travel EVA Air business but this time I had to get into BKK early having been told by many that BA Business is at best rubbish I decided to save some cash and go P/Economy seat no: 14A remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and I was left with some sort of pasta dish - totally inedible. I must admit I didn't put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and hard. I was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. Drinks G&T were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least I did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor. The only redeeming factors were I didn't go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 2/4/2 configuration unlike EVA 1/2/1 lie flat and we arrived 20 minutes early.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Robert Kovacs,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I was excited to fly on the new A380 with the new seating. We sat in 14j and 14k. When we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. I sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. Well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. I not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. This is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger. I was told I would be contacted by a representative but that did not happen.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

I Jackson,,,3,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Club Europe - supposedly premium - had the misfortune of seat 1f - normally a great seat in Club Europe - but for a 4 hour flight LGW to ACE - cramped (not quite as bad as the rest of CE with new - not advertised - 30 inch rather than 34 inch seat pitch) - no window just a wall. Add to this limited luggage space think its EasyJet with middle seat free for £600 more. Is it worth it - no thinking avoid BA CE offering - shame I've a few flights to suffer yet.

Dave Robinson,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I flew LHR-YVR outwards 20th May 2014 on 747. The cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th June 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. The whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the TV set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats. I would be unlikely to book 1st class again with BA unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.,Unknown,First Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Bran Rovers,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Business class from Shanghai to London. It was the worst business class. Staff give the impression that they are above service and I did not feel that they were courteous or polite. On one occasion I asked for a glass of champagne and never got one on another occasion when I dropped my fork for the meal and buzzed for another one no one came when I tried to grab the attention of the staff member walking past he said sorry sir I'll be right with you and never came. Eventually I just went to the back and grabbed one. I would never fly BA again for the money you pay you can get much better business class and value from other airlines.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Food choice is excellent and service as always of a very high standard. Not too sure about the new wash bags large draw string bag with minimal contents the wash bags get bigger but the contents get smaller! Nothing really useful in the wash bag not even eye masks or ear plugs. Useful contents would be mouth wash wet wipes etc it is about time BA looked at returning to Molton Brown which was a lot superior than the Elimis range. Otherwise a great flight met by special services on arrival in DXB who whisked me through Immigration and Customs within 20 mins of landing which exceeded all expectations.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

S Lewis,,,6,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"We travelled Club Europe from Gatwick to Paphos as we were going out to get married. The extra luggage was handy due to the dress and all the extras that we needed to take but we could have paid for the extra space at much less a cost. As it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go the full hog so spent nearly £1000 extra on Club Europe seats expecting to get a really good experience. Check in was quick and easy but there was no queue at the normal check in either so we didn't really benefit from that. The lounge was nothing particularly impressive although we didn't get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. We were let on the plane first through the front of the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through the same door and through the Club Europe section so to be able to put our bags up into the compartment I had to stand by my seat until the entire plane had boarded. The seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was ""extra room"" it wasn't what I'd have expected. Our bags were marked as priority with the tags but came out with the rest of the luggage. I don't know if we went in expecting more than we should have but for the extra money we paid I think we were entitled to have higher expectations. Not an ideal way to start our wedding experience. We'd never travel Club Europe again it was a complete waste of money so hopefully others will read this and save the money to spend on the rest of the holiday!",Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

J Yates,,,10,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LHR-LAX-LHR. This route is the new A380 which I was very much looking forward to travelling on it certainly did not disappoint. I paid £20 extra to reserve seats in the upper deck at the very back this area is only 4 rows separated by galley and toilets and really does feel like its own private cabin. Plus the seating on the upper deck in a 2-4-2 layout means sitting by the window not only feels more spacious as you only have 1 person next to you but due to the shape of the A380 you get huge amounts of shoulder room and access to little storage lockers below the window.

Mark Murphy,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I really do not have the energy to write very detail of how bad my very recent flight too (and from) Vegas was with BA however I can categorically state I will never fly with them again and am bewildered as to how they survive a superior option as an airline. Highlights of my journey include: Severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. Delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. Running out of food and beverage 1 hr into a 11 hour flight. (No beer 1 hr in to flight - after the 90 minute delay). Uninterested and incompetent staff. Lost luggage. (1 case has so far turned up). Space reduced to less than a foot (Head to back of seat) once person in front inevitably reclines. I could honestly go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being completely honest when I say that I am an easy customer to please. If you have Virgin as an option even its a bit more expensive please take my word for it and go with them they are a class apart. BA operate as a (poor) budget airline posing as something else. Very poor journey shocking experience.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
Charlie Harm,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Flew in Club World for the first time on the new BA A380s. Big disappointment. The two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. The dinner service on the LHR-JNB flight was chronically slow (about three hours from beginning to end). The staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys (rather than from a trolley) and to plate all the meals. All this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers. The cabin crew were also curiously bad tempered perhaps due to the frustration of trying to deliver an over complicated meal service to increasingly disgruntled passengers. A pity as the planes are quieter than previous generation aircraft and the flight was very smooth.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Owen Phoneix,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,Gatwick to Malaga late May. I have travelled this route literally hundreds of times the number of airlines that have or currently operate this route over the years gives a good choice of flight times and fares. However I find myself using BA as the norm. The flights are well priced usually on time the aircraft are clean and comfortable although they could be newer. Legroom is great especially if you can bag a seat in the first eight rows these have 34 inches of legroom. Organised boarding makes a huge positive difference as well.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
Bedingfield Elizabeth,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Travelled back from Tampa to Gatwick Friday 30th May. This flight proved that it is the crew that make a good or bad flight. This one was really bad. I was booked in Club normally the plane is a three class 777. On Friday it was a four class that was flying and I was lucky enough to be seated in the First Class cabin. Although it was not classed as an upgrade to First because it was business class service it should still have been a lovely experience. Yes the seat and all the space was great but the first words I heard as being offered a drink was - ""Can't wait for this flight to be over"". This was from one of the stewards to another steward but that attitude was the same amongst all the crew serving the cabin. I hope BA read this forum as the service really was appalling. My husband was in the bathroom when breakfast was served he was ignored. A request of a cup of coffee was met with we will be landing in 40 minutes. So what should have been a real treat turned out to be the most disappointed I have ever been with BA.

An air traffic controller issue kept the plane grounded for 30 minutes. On board they'd forgotten the menus for the dinner service and the starter and cheese course had been left behind. The Club Europe toilet then ran out of water. So overall okay but the return was disappointing.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Kathleen Osborne,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I should be in a nice hotel in Romania instead 9 hours after I arrived in Heathrow courtesy of British Airways I am still in Heathrow heading back to Glasgow! The 7am flight went well 10/10 for getting me from Glasgow to London. The connecting flight to Bucharest was delayed by more than an hour which meant I wouldn't get my connecting flight to Timisoara. I duly went to customer services (waited 50 mins) who offered to get me to Timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last flight on 9/5/14 was fully booked. They offered to put me up in a hotel in Bucharest but were not able to book one. Having waited 50 mins at a BA desk where apparently there was nothing they could do to check availability of a hotel in Bucharest I was not filled with confidence. Since I was going out for only 48 hours and would miss a large part of my meeting I decided to go back to Glasgow. I was booked on the 15.50 to Glasgow and given a slip of paper with all the details and told to go to the gate when it was called as they would know all about the booking as it was on the computer. Told my boarding pass was sorted. They hadn't sorted it and I got a lecture about what I needed to do in future. There was no way I was getting on the flight told that I should be grateful as they were doing me a favour putting me on the 6.50pm flight. Told to go back to the service desk and wait in the queue again!,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

S Snehal,,,8,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,While different people have different experiences I wanted to share that I have mixed reviews both are great - one can be used as feedback while the other for pat on BA's backs! I was traveling BLR-LHR-SFO route on 9th of May 2014. The first flight from BLR-LHR was chaotic and as mentioned by others on this site most food options were exhausted by the end of the flight. I don't complain because I got my food choice. The flight staff had some really courteous people while some were pretty snobbish. The second flight is really what's worth mentioning - it was the most cheerful flight I have been on! The flight attendants were entertaining the pains of being on a second leg of a 24 hr journey was not felt. BA 287 flying on 9th May 2014 - fantastic flight. Food was okay - I loved the Lily O Brien chocolate mousse! Entertainment - its high time BA upgrades its entertainment systems. The audio was lousy and nothing was clear or audible even on the highest volume against the aircraft sounds.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Cabin crew were very efficient and friendly on both outbound and inbound flights.

The lounge is JFK was very crowded and not really relaxed. Boarding was again relaxed with a perfect crew on the Upper deck friendly and relaxed. Slept nearly the all flight in perfect conditions. The flight LHR-BRU was delayed with more than 40 minutes but the captain excused humbly for the delay and gave us plenty of information. business cabin was full but the service on this short flight was more than excellent.,Unknown,Business Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Loraine Droy,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I have just been reviewing all the reviews on this website and it seems every evident to me that if you are booked in First class you will more than lightly have a great flight economy or premium is touch and go! If you want to take the risk I travel BA to Tampa premium economy three times a year the food is disgusting and I always sit in aisle 14 now if anyone has booked there seat in this aisle be warned they run out of choices on the menu when they get to you and they offer you an economy meal and quite frankly they do not care if you complain well I complained! Myself and the man seated next to me kept up the complaining and 15 mins later the steward comes up with two beef dishes. The crew had kept these meals for themselves. So be aware that if you are seated in aisle 14 bring your own food because you will not get a decent meal.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Tanmay Bhakta,,,2,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.,Unknown,Premium Economy,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
P Harris,,,1,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,"Lanzarote to Gatwick on 13th April. Flight itself was okay but on arrival we were ""parked"" a long way from the baggage reclaim area (for which the Captain apologised). After a 30 minute walk from the plane our problems began as we then waited another more than 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. Many flights that landed a long time after us received our bags and set off home far more promptly. BA have acknowledged they are responsible for the journey from ""start to finish"" but have gone on to advise that some parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. Can't recommend BA because of this experience and because of the way our subsequent complaint has been handled. Not planning to use BA again because of this.",Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,

Cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. Certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. I've flown AF TAP SWISS KLM long haul in the past year and by far BA catering in economy is the poorest in content.

Perfunctory drinks service - when asking for a whisky and soda I was offered whisky and tonic. Paper cups for coffee at breakfast. Meals are better at a Little Chef.

On the way back it was a B737 which was clean but a bit tatty and felt cramped. Service food and drinks on both flights was commendable.

The positives of both flights were: they were on time seats were comfortable and lounges were good. The negatives were: very poor food selections on board (over cooked and uninspiring) very mixed crews - depending on what side of the aircraft you sat you got a totally different in-flight experience - some of the cabin crew should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the IFE was unreliable - on both flights the IFE had to be re-set at least once.

W Benson,,,4,Not Verified,British Airways customer review,LHR-HKG on Boeing 747 - 23/08/12. Much has been written about the tired old 747 fleet so I won't go in to that. What was annoying was that I was 4 rows from the front of the World Traveller cabin and by the time the crew had got to my row to serve lunch 1 of the 2 choices had already run out! That in itself would have been ok - it was perfectly acceptable pasta but the starter was a pasta salad. Not very sensible offering 2 dishes almost the same. The crew did what was required of them - serve drinks and food but then we didn't see them again for 9 hours until breakfast was served. I flew home in New Club World (see separate review) and my advice would be to fly in the best cabin you can afford. On a 12 hour flight it really is worthwhile.,Unknown,Economy Class,,,,46.3144754,11.0480288,,46.3144754,11.0480288,
